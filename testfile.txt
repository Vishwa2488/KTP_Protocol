_Needwood!_ if e’er my early voice
           Hath taught thy echoes to rejoice;
           If e’er my hounds in opening cry
           Have fill’d thy banks with ecstacy;
           If e’er array’d in cheerful green
           Our train hath deck’d thy wintry scene;
           Ere yet thy wood-wild walks I leave,
           My tributary verse receive:
           With thy own wreath my brows adorn,
           And to thy praises tune my horn!

             What green-rob’d Nymph, all loose her hair,
           With buskin’d leg, and bosom bare,
           Steps lightly down the turfy glades,
           And beckons tow’rd yon opening shades?—
           No harlot-form, dissembling guile
           With wanton air and painted smile,
           Lures to enchanted halls or bowers,
           Where festive Vice consumes his hours.
           Her mild and modest looks dispense
           The simple charm of innocence:
           And a sweet wildness in her eye
           Sparkles with young sincerity.—
           Lead on, fair guide, ere wakes the dawn,
           With thee I’ll climb the steepy lawn,
           With thee the leafy labyrinths trace,
           Where dwells the Genius of the place.—
           His large limbs press a prim-rose bed,
           A moss-grown root sustains his head,
           And, list’ning to a Druid’s rhimes,
           He bends his eye on distant times:
           While troops of sylvan Vassals meet
           To cast their garlands at his feet,
           And pipe and frisk in rings about,
           Or parly with the Hunter’s shout.
           And now a fragrant show’r he throws
           Of blossoms from his curled brows,
           And rising waves his oaken wand,
           And bids yon magic scenes expand!—

             First blush the hills with orient light,
           And pierce the sable veil of night,
           Green bends the waving shade above,
           And glist’ring dew-drops gem the grove:
           Next shine the shelving lawns around,
           Bright threads of silver net the ground;
           And down, the entangled brakes among,
           The white rill sparkling winds along:
           Then, as the pausing zephyrs breathe,
           The billowy mist recedes beneath;
           Slow, as it rolls away, unfold
           The vale’s fresh glories green and gold;
           DOVE[1] laughs, and shakes his tresses bright,
           And trails afar a line of light.

             Now glows the illumin’d landscape round!
           Ye Vulgar hence!—’tis sacred ground!
           Hence to the flimsy walks of art,
           That lull, but not transport the heart.
           Nature, O Muse, here sits alone,
           And marks these regions for thy own;
           Here her variety of joys
           Nor season bounds, nor change destroys:
           Be mine the pride, tho’ weak my strains,
           That first I woo’d thee to these plains;
           Where Spring, in all her beauty drest,
           But promises a brighter guest:
           Where Summer yields her greens and flowers
           To Autumn’s variegated bowers:
           Smiles Winter, as their honours fall,
           And bids his hollies shame them all.[2]

             Ye sage Professors of design,
           Whom system’s stubborn rules confine,
           Can science here one blemish show?
           Or one deficient grace bestow?
           EMES,[3] who yon desart wild explor’d,
           And to it’s name the scene restor’d;
           Whose art is nature’s law maintain’d,
           Whose order negligence restrain’d,
           Here, fir’d by native beauty, trac’d
           The foot-steps of the Goddess, Taste:
           Won from her coy retreats she came,
           And led him up these paths to fame.

             Here ev’ry flower improves the gale
           From the meek violet of the vale
           To her, who flaunts in air sublime,
           The woodbine, queen of summer’s prime:
           While each delicious shade may vie
           With those of boasted Arcady.
           There sweet varieties appear
           Of thickets, shap’d by nibbling Deer,
           Of hills, that swell with gradual ease,
           Wood-skirted lawns, and scatter’d trees;
           Of vallies seen down distant glades,
           That break the mass of mingling shades;
           While nature’s attribute, extent,
           Crowns each inferior ornament!—

             On this green unambitious brow,
           Fair Mistress of the vale below,
           With sloping hills enclos’d around,
           Their heads with oaks and hollies crown’d,
           With lucky choice, by happy hands,
           Plac’d in good hour, my dwelling stands;
           And draws the distant trav’ler’s eye,
           Enamour’d of it’s scenery;
           Where all things give, what all express,
           Content and rural happiness.
           Where far retir’d from life’s dull form
           Comes no intruder but the storm;
           The storm, that with contrasted low’r
           Endears the fair the silent hour.

             Thus their wise days our fathers led,
           Fleet ran their hounds, their arrows sped,
           And jocund Health with rosy smile
           Look’d on, companion of their toil:
           Till tyrant Law usurp’d the land,
           Stretch’d o’er the woods his iron hand,
           Forbad the echoing horn to blow,
           Maim’d the staunch hound, and snapp’d the bow.[4]

             Here with fair peace and modest fame[5]
           They dwelt, who boasted Bagot’s name,—
           Go, BAGOT, plead your country’s cause,
           While senates listen with applause,
           With fearless truth and manly sense
           Detecting specious eloquence:
           Great talents to the world are due,
           Retirement were a crime in you.
           Go, and receive your oaken crown!
           Here, with no title to renown,
           Leave me to loiter at my door
           Beneath the spreading sycamore,
           That canopies the sloping lawn;
           And view the deer at early dawn
           In troops come winding down the hill
           To taste fresh herbage near the rill;
           Or count at noon their slumb’ring heaps;
           At evening watch their playful leaps;
           Or hear the quiring of the grove
           Give breath to harmony and love;
           Or listen to the hum profound,
           In the still air that floats around;
           Or mark yon hills extended side,
           Where turf and shade the space divide;—
           Here the wood straggles tow’rd the plain,
           The pasture there prevails again;
           The heifer grazes on it’s brow,
           Clamours the rook on trees below;
           Gay golden furze and purple ling
           Around their mixt embroidery fling,
           O’er all, irregularly join’d,
           Th’ according outline waves behind.

             No dusky Cares o’er-hang the bower,
           No Passions wreck the halcyon hour;
           Nurs’d in the shade Reflection springs,
           Smooths her white plumes, and tries her wings.
           No leaf of autumn falls in vain;
           No flower-bell droops beneath the rain,
           No bubble down the current flows,
           But life’s uncertain tenure shows.
           Those thorns protect the forest’s hopes;
           That tree the slender ivy props:
           Thus rise the mighty on the mean!
           Thus on the strong the feeble lean!
           In yonder holly—blush mankind!—
           A rare fidelity I find;
           Like yours tho’ summer’s flatteries end,
           My winter here hath found a friend.—
           Hail faithful fav’rite tree! to you
           The Muse shall pay observance due:
           Whether in horrent files you stand
           Round sapling oaks a guardian band;
           Or form aloft a shelt’ring bower
           Impervious to the sun or shower;
           Whether to yon hill-side you throng
           Ranging in various groups along;
           Or on the plain, maturely grown,
           You boldly brave the storm alone,
           Or tapering high, with woodbines hid,
           Rise in a fragrant pyramid;
           Your vigorous youth with upright shoots,
           Your verdant age, your glowing fruits,
           Your glossy leaves, and columns gray
           Shall live the favorites of my lay!

             Alas! in vain with warmth and food
           You cheer the songsters of the wood,
           The barbarous boy from you prepares
           On treacherous twigs his viscous snares.
           Yes, the poor bird, you nurs’d, shall find
           Destruction in your rifled rind.
           Thus good and ill too often meet,
           And bitter mingles with the sweet!
           —Ye pedagogues! let truant youth
           Imbibe from you this gen’rous truth;
           That one humane, one tender thought
           Is worth the whole, that schools have taught.


                               PART, II.

            With what fond gaze my eye pursues,
            _NEEDWOOD_, thy sweetly-varying views!
            Satyr, or Nymph, or sylvan God
            A fairer circuit never trod!
            Charm’d, as I turn, thy pictures seem
            The golden fabricks of a dream.
            Where Fiction stands with prism bright,
            Rays forth her many-colour’d light,
            Dyes the green herb, and purple flower,
            Gives glittering lustres to the shower;
            Then gilds with livelier tints the sky,
            Or bends her radiant bow on high.

              To scenes so elegantly wild
            Fancy, of old, her darling child
            From AVON’S flowery margin brought,
            And ARDEN boasts what NEEDWOOD taught.[6]

              Such shades by mazy paths perplex’d,
            Where strays the traveller inly vex’d,
            Inspir’d the Muse of SPENCER’S pen;
            The _wandering wood_, and _Errors den_,[7]
            Dwarfs, Palfreys, Dames, and Giants rise
            Full on Imaginations eyes!
            See, See the Sarazin advance!
            The red-cross Knight hath couch’d his lance!
            They meet, the Christian wins the field,
            And bears away the _faithless_ shield![8]

              With such companions fond to rove,
            I venerate each hill and grove,
            To Phœbus as to Dian dear,
            And find a new Parnassus here.
            Here might the sacred sisters dwell
            By pebbly brook, or gushing well:
            O let me listen, as they sing,
            In some close vale beside a spring,
            Whose stream the intruding alder chides,
            Where the wild-bee her treasure hides!—
            Or sit in high imbowering shade
            With Contemplation, heav’n-ey’d maid,
            Where the scant sun through branches thin
            Chequers the dark green floor within;
            Where ev’ry leaf is wisdom’s page,
            And each gray trunk a hoary sage.
            Nor motion, human form, or noise
            This solemn pause of life destroys;
            Save where the playful squirrel bounds,
            Or ring-dove pours her plaintive sounds,
            Or lurking peasant lops an oak
            Restraining half his pilfering stroke,
            Or with his faggot stoops to rest
            Both by his years and burthen prest.

              Here, seen of old, the elfin race
            With sprightly vigils mark’d the place;
            Their gay processions charm’d the sight,
            Gilding the lucid noon of night;
            Or, when obscure the midnight hour,
            With glow-worm lantherns hung the bower.
            —Hark!—the soft lute! along the green
            Moves with majestic step the queen!
            Attendant Fays around her throng,
            And trace the dance or raise the song;
            Or touch the shrill reed, as they trip,
            With finger light and ruby lip.

              High, on her brow sublime, is born
            One scarlet wood-bine’s tremulous horn;
            A gaudy bee-bird’s triple plume[9]
            Sheds on her neck its waving gloom;
            With silvery gossamer entwin’d
            Stream the luxuriant locks behind.
            Thin folds of tangled network break
            In airy waves adown her neck:
            Warp’d in his loom, the spider spread
            The far-diverging rays of thread,
            Then round and round with shuttle fine
            Inwrought the undulating line.
            One rose-leaf forms her crimson vest,
            The loose edge crosses o’er her breast.
            And one translucent fold, which fell
            From the tall lily’s ample bell,
            Forms with sweet grace her snowy train,
            Flows, as she steps, and sweeps the plain.
            Silence and Night inchanted gaze,
            And Hesper hides his vanquish’d rays!—

              Now the wak’d reed-birds swell their throats,
            And night-larks trill their mingled notes:
            Yet hush’d in moss with writhed neck
            The black-bird hides his golden beak;
            Charm’d from his dream of love, he wakes,
            Opes his gay eye, his plumage shakes,
            And stretching wide each ebon wing,
            First in low whispers tries to sing;
            Then sounds his clarion loud, and thrills
            The moon-bright lawns, and shadowy hills.
            Silent the choral Fays attend,
            And then their silver voices blend,
            Each shining thread of sound prolong,
            And weave the magic woof of song.
            Pleas’d Philomela takes her stand
            On high, and leads the fairy band,
            Pours sweet at intervals her strain,
            And guides with beating wing the train.
            Whilst interrupted zephyrs bear
            Hoarse murmurs from the distant wear;
            And at each pause is heard the swell
            Of Echo’s soft symphonius shell.

              Nor the dread night my mind alarms,—
            NIGHT, and her horrors have their charms.
            O’er the wide forest oft I roam,
            What time the trav’ler, far from home,
            Bewilder’d in the pathless brakes,
            There his cold bed despairing makes;
            And hear the fox with savage bark
            Pay distant courtship through the dark;
            The owl with fault’ring voice unfold
            Her tale, like one who shakes with cold:
            And then the alarmed woods resound
            Th’ upbraidings of the well-train’d hound,
            Who with tremendous tongue arraigns
            And haunts the plunderer of his plains.
            So cries from earth the life-blood spilt,
            So waking furies harrass guilt!

              Oft have I through this solemn glade
            Of old dismember’d hollies stray’d,
            Whose bold bare rugged brows are seen
            Thrust through the mantling ever-green;
            Tall clustring columns here ascend,
            And there in gothic arches bend;[10]
            Whilst, as the silver moon-beams rise,
            Imagin’d temples strike my eyes,
            With tottering spire, and mouldering wall,
            And high roof nodding to its fall.—
            His lantern gleaming down the glade,
            One, like a sexton with his spade,[11]
            Comes from their caverns to exclude
            The mid-night prowlers of the wood.—
            Through fields of air while pausing slow,
            Yon death-bell tells the village woe!

              Born on her clouds when Darkness flings
            O’er the still air her raven wings,
            Ere yet the watery freight descends,
            While Heaven it’s purposes suspends,
            NIGHT, let me stand in silent trance,
            And watch the lightning’s kindling glance:
            While, stiff’ning at the imagin’d stroke,
            Appears behind a brighten’d oak,
            From justice fled to this wild place,
            A conscious robber’s gastly face!—
            Or fancy views with fear-fix’d eye
            A mangled spectre gliding by,
            Quick with the flash who seems to wave
            His pale hand, beck’ning to a grave!—
            And, as the fleeting vision dies,
            Loud thunders shake the closing skies.

              NIGHT, when rude blasts thy scenes deform,
            O place me in the perilous storm!
            While the moon labouring thro’ the clouds
            By turns her light reveals and shrouds;
            Torn from it’s trunk, when whirlwinds bear
            The twisted ash aloft in air:
            And some vast elm’s uprooted spoil
            Ploughs in its headlong fall the soil.
            While, as he stalks thro’ groaning oaks,
            At intervals the old deer croaks:
            And the lean sow with paps drawn dry
            O’er rustling leaves trots whining by.—

              Then posts across the blasted plain,
            Born on the wild storm, Witchcraft’s train,
            Aghast with guilt, and shrunk with age,
            And yelling with demoniack rage!—
            With eyes turn’d back malign and wide
            See blood-stain’d Murder silent stride,
            A moon-beam’s sudden light expands,
            He starts, and hides his crimson hands!—
            And now the cauldron gleams afar,
            Fir’d by a baneful meteor’s glare,
            Around they dance, they pause, and pour
            The mischiefs of the midnight hour;
            While trembling fiends with wonder gaze,
            Stretch their black wings, and fan the blaze!


                               PART, III.

           Ere Night withdraws her starry train,
           I print long traces o’er the plain,
           And bend my eyes to yon bright east
           To meet the Morning’s radiant guest,
           As o’er the hill his golden rays
           Burst thro’ the thicket in a blaze.
           Now from my foot the startled fawn
           Bounds to its parent on the lawn;
           And the wak’d lark exulting springs,
           Hangs high in air on quivering wings,
           Chaunts his loud transports o’er the heath,
           And eyes his list’ning loves beneath.

             Oft shall my TALBOT hither stray,
           And friendship give new joys to day;
           On him his blooming bride attend,
           Hither her graceful footsteps bend,
           Fresh life her brighter beauties fling
           O’er the young dawn, and blossom’d spring.

             They come! their eddying wheels resound,
           The harness’d coursers proudly bound,
           The light-hung chariot floats in air,
           And laughing Hymen wreaths the pair!
           As o’er the daisy’d lawns they move
           By glittering rill or dusky grove,
           Old NEEDWOOD calls his softest gale,
           Bids all his fragrant buds exhale:
           His gazing herds around them throng,
           His plighted birds suspend their song,
           Each on her urn his Naiads lean,
           And Wood-nymphs peep from allies green.

             Where this gay mount o’er-looks the wood,[12]
           Charm’d with the scene a monarch stood,
           Call’d these fair plains the richest gem,
           That deck’d his triple diadem,
           Awhile the cares of state forgot,
           And with it’s name adorn’d the spot.

             Down yon meridian fields afar
           When Mercia led her chiefs to war,
           Fell in one hour three monarchs brave,
           And LICHFIELD’S bower protects their grave.[13]
           Her stately spires amidst the skies
           Ting’d by the orient sun arise,
           With golden vanes invite the gale.—
           Triumphant ladies of the vale!

             Down yon mid-vale the british Nile,[14]
           Fair DOVE, comes winding many a mile;
           And from his copious urn distils
           The fatness of a thousand hills.
           Swell, generous river, leave thy banks,
           The thirsty soil shall give thee thanks!—
           The generous river swells, and leads
           His waters o’er impoverish’d meads,
           And lays his ample treasure down,
           Rich emblem of thy bounty, BROWN![15]

             Pleas’d on yon high abode I gaze,
           Whence C’ANDISH foaming Dove surveys:[16]
           And where those humbler vales extend
           Of thine, FITZHERBERT, chearful friend.[17]
           Or mark upon yon round ascent
           The social flag and open tent,[18]
           Where life’s smooth paths with sweets are strown,
           And mirth makes every hour it’s own.

             Where spreads this grove it’s umbrage wide
           Late the bold Outlaw fought and died.[19]
           Oft in it’s dark recess the oak
           Had fall’n beneath his secret stroke,
           Full many a deer the night’s dim ray
           Beheld his silent arrow slay,
           Deep furze conceal’d the fawns in vain,
           And lust of lucre thinn’d the plain.
           Here, by no power before controll’d,
           He met a forester as bold;
           O’er the fierce conflict frown’d the wood,
           And drank with thirsty roots his blood.

             Yon bank demands a pitying look,
           Where life a gentler breast forsook;[20]
           Sole comfort of an aged pair!
           The true-love of a damsel fair!—
           At prime of dawn he stepp’d away;
           Long was the journey, short the day;
           The wint’ry blast blew loud and chill;
           Night caught him on the unshelter’d hill;
           Fatigu’d he fell; no help came nigh;
           His faithful dog alone was by;
           Who, as he fondly lick’d his cheek,
           Heard his expiring master speak.
           “Heap not for me thy cottage-fire;
           “Cold grows my heart, unhappy sire!
           “But turn to my unfinish’d loom,
           “And weave the web, and bear it home!
           “Prepare not, dame, my evening meal;
           “But bid them ring my passing peal!
           “Deck not thyself, dear maid, to meet
           “Thy love; but bring his winding sheet!
           “I come not to your festive cheer;
           “Ye comrades, place me on my bier!—”
           —The morrow found him stiff and pale:
           Mournful the Muse recounts his tale.

             Her stately tower there HANBURY rears,
           Which proudly looks o’er distant shires;
           Down the chill slope and darken’d glade
           Projects afar it’s length of shade;
           Assails the skies with giant force,
           And checks the whirlwind in it’s course;
           Or, when black clouds involve the pole,
           Disarms the thunders, as they roll!—
           Beneath how Nature throws around
           Grand inequalities of ground,
           While down the dells and o’er the steeps
           The wavy line of Paphos creeps!—

             With awful sorrow I behold
           Yon cliff, that frowns with ruins old;[21]
           Stout FERRERS there kept faithless ward,[22]
           And GAUNT perform’d his Castle-guard.[23]
           There captive MARY look’d in vain[24]
           For NORFOLK, and her nuptial train;
           Enrich’d with royal tears the Dove,
           But sigh’d for freedom, not from love.
           ’Twas once the seat of festive state,
           Where high born dames and nobles sat;
           While minstrels, each in order heard,[25]
           Their venerable songs preferr’d.
           False memory of it’s state remains
           In the rude sport of brutal swains.[26]
           Now serpents hiss, and foxes dwell
           Amidst the mould’ring citadel;
           And time but spares those broken towers
           In mockery of human powers.

             Yon hill, that glows with southern rays,[27]
           All-conscious of superior praise,
           Swells her smooth top and pastures green,
           And of her sisters seems the queen;
           Proud from her ancient seats to trace
           The lineage of a generous race.
           “That generous race,” fair SUDBURY cries,
           “Is mine,” and bids her turrets rise,
           Lifts from the lap of peace her dome,
           Where finds Munificence a home;
           Then wide her shining lake she leads
           Through blossom’d groves and emerald meads,
           Cloaths with dark woods the distant scene,
           And pours her dappled herds between.
           —Ah me! what sudden sadness lowers
           O’er her fair front and vernal bowers!
           There sinks to her untimely tomb
           A virgin flower in beauty’s bloom!
           O thou wast all that youth admires,
           A parent loves, or friend desires!
           I knew thee well! my sorrowing heart
           Bears in thy loss a bitter part!—
           Whilst the sad Muse in plaintive verse
           Strews all her flowers around thy hearse,
           Let Pity quit thy grave, and go
           A mourner to yon house of woe.
           There from thy father’s bosom break
           Sighs, which too eloquently speak:
           Thy mother weeps, but weeps resign’d,
           In all things noble, most in mind:
           Pale griefs thy sisters’ cheeks invade;
           And one, alas, too tender maid!
           Holds a long melancholy strife
           Betwixt her sorrows and her life:
           Thy manly brothers strive to cure
           In vain, the pangs themselves endure.
           Fair Saint! a happier lot is thine
           Repos’d beneath the silent shrine!

             Now let me seek in pensive mood
           The rude recesses of the wood;
           And, where congenial gloom extends,
           Think of lost hopes and distant friends;
           Of scenes, whose pleasures fled too fast,
           And hours most valued now they’re past!

             Beside me lies a dingle deep,[28]
           With shaggy banks abrupt and steep;
           Through vistas wild my course I bend,
           Till day-light opens at the end:
           Where from intoxicating height
           Bursts the wide prospect on my sight.
           The terrace bold, on which I stand,
           Steps broad and forward on the land;
           Rude hills compose the side-long scene,
           With crofts and cottages between:
           The various landscape onward spreads
           O’er cultur’d plains and verdant meads;
           And seats, and towns, and hamlets rise,
           Where yon smoke curls into the skies,
           And spires, that pierce thro’ tufted trees;
           Till, faintly fading by degrees,
           Beyond, in wild confusion tost,
           The hills blue tops in clouds are lost.

             Yes, EATON-BANKS, in vain I strive[29]
           To hide the grief your oaks revive.—
           Bow thy tall branches, grateful wood!
           Afford me blossom, leaf, and bud!
           He, for whose memory these I blend,
           Thy late-lost master, was my friend!—
           Fall, gentle dews! fresh zephyrs, breathe!
           Spread, cooling shades! preserve my wreath!—
           Alas, it withers ere its time!—
           So faded he in manly prime!—
           But Virtue, scorning friendship’s aid,
           Rears her own palms, which never fade!
           _Needwood!_ if e’er my early voice
           Hath taught thy echoes to rejoice;
           If e’er my hounds in opening cry
           Have fill’d thy banks with ecstacy;
           If e’er array’d in cheerful green
           Our train hath deck’d thy wintry scene;
           Ere yet thy wood-wild walks I leave,
           My tributary verse receive:
           With thy own wreath my brows adorn,
           And to thy praises tune my horn!

             What green-rob’d Nymph, all loose her hair,
           With buskin’d leg, and bosom bare,
           Steps lightly down the turfy glades,
           And beckons tow’rd yon opening shades?—
           No harlot-form, dissembling guile
           With wanton air and painted smile,
           Lures to enchanted halls or bowers,
           Where festive Vice consumes his hours.
           Her mild and modest looks dispense
           The simple charm of innocence:
           And a sweet wildness in her eye
           Sparkles with young sincerity.—
           Lead on, fair guide, ere wakes the dawn,
           With thee I’ll climb the steepy lawn,
           With thee the leafy labyrinths trace,
           Where dwells the Genius of the place.—
           His large limbs press a prim-rose bed,
           A moss-grown root sustains his head,
           And, list’ning to a Druid’s rhimes,
           He bends his eye on distant times:
           While troops of sylvan Vassals meet
           To cast their garlands at his feet,
           And pipe and frisk in rings about,
           Or parly with the Hunter’s shout.
           And now a fragrant show’r he throws
           Of blossoms from his curled brows,
           And rising waves his oaken wand,
           And bids yon magic scenes expand!—

             First blush the hills with orient light,
           And pierce the sable veil of night,
           Green bends the waving shade above,
           And glist’ring dew-drops gem the grove:
           Next shine the shelving lawns around,
           Bright threads of silver net the ground;
           And down, the entangled brakes among,
           The white rill sparkling winds along:
           Then, as the pausing zephyrs breathe,
           The billowy mist recedes beneath;
           Slow, as it rolls away, unfold
           The vale’s fresh glories green and gold;
           DOVE[1] laughs, and shakes his tresses bright,
           And trails afar a line of light.

             Now glows the illumin’d landscape round!
           Ye Vulgar hence!—’tis sacred ground!
           Hence to the flimsy walks of art,
           That lull, but not transport the heart.
           Nature, O Muse, here sits alone,
           And marks these regions for thy own;
           Here her variety of joys
           Nor season bounds, nor change destroys:
           Be mine the pride, tho’ weak my strains,
           That first I woo’d thee to these plains;
           Where Spring, in all her beauty drest,
           But promises a brighter guest:
           Where Summer yields her greens and flowers
           To Autumn’s variegated bowers:
           Smiles Winter, as their honours fall,
           And bids his hollies shame them all.[2]

             Ye sage Professors of design,
           Whom system’s stubborn rules confine,
           Can science here one blemish show?
           Or one deficient grace bestow?
           EMES,[3] who yon desart wild explor’d,
           And to it’s name the scene restor’d;
           Whose art is nature’s law maintain’d,
           Whose order negligence restrain’d,
           Here, fir’d by native beauty, trac’d
           The foot-steps of the Goddess, Taste:
           Won from her coy retreats she came,
           And led him up these paths to fame.

             Here ev’ry flower improves the gale
           From the meek violet of the vale
           To her, who flaunts in air sublime,
           The woodbine, queen of summer’s prime:
           While each delicious shade may vie
           With those of boasted Arcady.
           There sweet varieties appear
           Of thickets, shap’d by nibbling Deer,
           Of hills, that swell with gradual ease,
           Wood-skirted lawns, and scatter’d trees;
           Of vallies seen down distant glades,
           That break the mass of mingling shades;
           While nature’s attribute, extent,
           Crowns each inferior ornament!—

             On this green unambitious brow,
           Fair Mistress of the vale below,
           With sloping hills enclos’d around,
           Their heads with oaks and hollies crown’d,
           With lucky choice, by happy hands,
           Plac’d in good hour, my dwelling stands;
           And draws the distant trav’ler’s eye,
           Enamour’d of it’s scenery;
           Where all things give, what all express,
           Content and rural happiness.
           Where far retir’d from life’s dull form
           Comes no intruder but the storm;
           The storm, that with contrasted low’r
           Endears the fair the silent hour.

             Thus their wise days our fathers led,
           Fleet ran their hounds, their arrows sped,
           And jocund Health with rosy smile
           Look’d on, companion of their toil:
           Till tyrant Law usurp’d the land,
           Stretch’d o’er the woods his iron hand,
           Forbad the echoing horn to blow,
           Maim’d the staunch hound, and snapp’d the bow.[4]

             Here with fair peace and modest fame[5]
           They dwelt, who boasted Bagot’s name,—
           Go, BAGOT, plead your country’s cause,
           While senates listen with applause,
           With fearless truth and manly sense
           Detecting specious eloquence:
           Great talents to the world are due,
           Retirement were a crime in you.
           Go, and receive your oaken crown!
           Here, with no title to renown,
           Leave me to loiter at my door
           Beneath the spreading sycamore,
           That canopies the sloping lawn;
           And view the deer at early dawn
           In troops come winding down the hill
           To taste fresh herbage near the rill;
           Or count at noon their slumb’ring heaps;
           At evening watch their playful leaps;
           Or hear the quiring of the grove
           Give breath to harmony and love;
           Or listen to the hum profound,
           In the still air that floats around;
           Or mark yon hills extended side,
           Where turf and shade the space divide;—
           Here the wood straggles tow’rd the plain,
           The pasture there prevails again;
           The heifer grazes on it’s brow,
           Clamours the rook on trees below;
           Gay golden furze and purple ling
           Around their mixt embroidery fling,
           O’er all, irregularly join’d,
           Th’ according outline waves behind.

             No dusky Cares o’er-hang the bower,
           No Passions wreck the halcyon hour;
           Nurs’d in the shade Reflection springs,
           Smooths her white plumes, and tries her wings.
           No leaf of autumn falls in vain;
           No flower-bell droops beneath the rain,
           No bubble down the current flows,
           But life’s uncertain tenure shows.
           Those thorns protect the forest’s hopes;
           That tree the slender ivy props:
           Thus rise the mighty on the mean!
           Thus on the strong the feeble lean!
           In yonder holly—blush mankind!—
           A rare fidelity I find;
           Like yours tho’ summer’s flatteries end,
           My winter here hath found a friend.—
           Hail faithful fav’rite tree! to you
           The Muse shall pay observance due:
           Whether in horrent files you stand
           Round sapling oaks a guardian band;
           Or form aloft a shelt’ring bower
           Impervious to the sun or shower;
           Whether to yon hill-side you throng
           Ranging in various groups along;
           Or on the plain, maturely grown,
           You boldly brave the storm alone,
           Or tapering high, with woodbines hid,
           Rise in a fragrant pyramid;
           Your vigorous youth with upright shoots,
           Your verdant age, your glowing fruits,
           Your glossy leaves, and columns gray
           Shall live the favorites of my lay!

             Alas! in vain with warmth and food
           You cheer the songsters of the wood,
           The barbarous boy from you prepares
           On treacherous twigs his viscous snares.
           Yes, the poor bird, you nurs’d, shall find
           Destruction in your rifled rind.
           Thus good and ill too often meet,
           And bitter mingles with the sweet!
           —Ye pedagogues! let truant youth
           Imbibe from you this gen’rous truth;
           That one humane, one tender thought
           Is worth the whole, that schools have taught.


                               PART, II.

            With what fond gaze my eye pursues,
            _NEEDWOOD_, thy sweetly-varying views!
            Satyr, or Nymph, or sylvan God
            A fairer circuit never trod!
            Charm’d, as I turn, thy pictures seem
            The golden fabricks of a dream.
            Where Fiction stands with prism bright,
            Rays forth her many-colour’d light,
            Dyes the green herb, and purple flower,
            Gives glittering lustres to the shower;
            Then gilds with livelier tints the sky,
            Or bends her radiant bow on high.

              To scenes so elegantly wild
            Fancy, of old, her darling child
            From AVON’S flowery margin brought,
            And ARDEN boasts what NEEDWOOD taught.[6]

              Such shades by mazy paths perplex’d,
            Where strays the traveller inly vex’d,
            Inspir’d the Muse of SPENCER’S pen;
            The _wandering wood_, and _Errors den_,[7]
            Dwarfs, Palfreys, Dames, and Giants rise
            Full on Imaginations eyes!
            See, See the Sarazin advance!
            The red-cross Knight hath couch’d his lance!
            They meet, the Christian wins the field,
            And bears away the _faithless_ shield![8]

              With such companions fond to rove,
            I venerate each hill and grove,
            To Phœbus as to Dian dear,
            And find a new Parnassus here.
            Here might the sacred sisters dwell
            By pebbly brook, or gushing well:
            O let me listen, as they sing,
            In some close vale beside a spring,
            Whose stream the intruding alder chides,
            Where the wild-bee her treasure hides!—
            Or sit in high imbowering shade
            With Contemplation, heav’n-ey’d maid,
            Where the scant sun through branches thin
            Chequers the dark green floor within;
            Where ev’ry leaf is wisdom’s page,
            And each gray trunk a hoary sage.
            Nor motion, human form, or noise
            This solemn pause of life destroys;
            Save where the playful squirrel bounds,
            Or ring-dove pours her plaintive sounds,
            Or lurking peasant lops an oak
            Restraining half his pilfering stroke,
            Or with his faggot stoops to rest
            Both by his years and burthen prest.

              Here, seen of old, the elfin race
            With sprightly vigils mark’d the place;
            Their gay processions charm’d the sight,
            Gilding the lucid noon of night;
            Or, when obscure the midnight hour,
            With glow-worm lantherns hung the bower.
            —Hark!—the soft lute! along the green
            Moves with majestic step the queen!
            Attendant Fays around her throng,
            And trace the dance or raise the song;
            Or touch the shrill reed, as they trip,
            With finger light and ruby lip.

              High, on her brow sublime, is born
            One scarlet wood-bine’s tremulous horn;
            A gaudy bee-bird’s triple plume[9]
            Sheds on her neck its waving gloom;
            With silvery gossamer entwin’d
            Stream the luxuriant locks behind.
            Thin folds of tangled network break
            In airy waves adown her neck:
            Warp’d in his loom, the spider spread
            The far-diverging rays of thread,
            Then round and round with shuttle fine
            Inwrought the undulating line.
            One rose-leaf forms her crimson vest,
            The loose edge crosses o’er her breast.
            And one translucent fold, which fell
            From the tall lily’s ample bell,
            Forms with sweet grace her snowy train,
            Flows, as she steps, and sweeps the plain.
            Silence and Night inchanted gaze,
            And Hesper hides his vanquish’d rays!—

              Now the wak’d reed-birds swell their throats,
            And night-larks trill their mingled notes:
            Yet hush’d in moss with writhed neck
            The black-bird hides his golden beak;
            Charm’d from his dream of love, he wakes,
            Opes his gay eye, his plumage shakes,
            And stretching wide each ebon wing,
            First in low whispers tries to sing;
            Then sounds his clarion loud, and thrills
            The moon-bright lawns, and shadowy hills.
            Silent the choral Fays attend,
            And then their silver voices blend,
            Each shining thread of sound prolong,
            And weave the magic woof of song.
            Pleas’d Philomela takes her stand
            On high, and leads the fairy band,
            Pours sweet at intervals her strain,
            And guides with beating wing the train.
            Whilst interrupted zephyrs bear
            Hoarse murmurs from the distant wear;
            And at each pause is heard the swell
            Of Echo’s soft symphonius shell.

              Nor the dread night my mind alarms,—
            NIGHT, and her horrors have their charms.
            O’er the wide forest oft I roam,
            What time the trav’ler, far from home,
            Bewilder’d in the pathless brakes,
            There his cold bed despairing makes;
            And hear the fox with savage bark
            Pay distant courtship through the dark;
            The owl with fault’ring voice unfold
            Her tale, like one who shakes with cold:
            And then the alarmed woods resound
            Th’ upbraidings of the well-train’d hound,
            Who with tremendous tongue arraigns
            And haunts the plunderer of his plains.
            So cries from earth the life-blood spilt,
            So waking furies harrass guilt!

              Oft have I through this solemn glade
            Of old dismember’d hollies stray’d,
            Whose bold bare rugged brows are seen
            Thrust through the mantling ever-green;
            Tall clustring columns here ascend,
            And there in gothic arches bend;[10]
            Whilst, as the silver moon-beams rise,
            Imagin’d temples strike my eyes,
            With tottering spire, and mouldering wall,
            And high roof nodding to its fall.—
            His lantern gleaming down the glade,
            One, like a sexton with his spade,[11]
            Comes from their caverns to exclude
            The mid-night prowlers of the wood.—
            Through fields of air while pausing slow,
            Yon death-bell tells the village woe!

              Born on her clouds when Darkness flings
            O’er the still air her raven wings,
            Ere yet the watery freight descends,
            While Heaven it’s purposes suspends,
            NIGHT, let me stand in silent trance,
            And watch the lightning’s kindling glance:
            While, stiff’ning at the imagin’d stroke,
            Appears behind a brighten’d oak,
            From justice fled to this wild place,
            A conscious robber’s gastly face!—
            Or fancy views with fear-fix’d eye
            A mangled spectre gliding by,
            Quick with the flash who seems to wave
            His pale hand, beck’ning to a grave!—
            And, as the fleeting vision dies,
            Loud thunders shake the closing skies.

              NIGHT, when rude blasts thy scenes deform,
            O place me in the perilous storm!
            While the moon labouring thro’ the clouds
            By turns her light reveals and shrouds;
            Torn from it’s trunk, when whirlwinds bear
            The twisted ash aloft in air:
            And some vast elm’s uprooted spoil
            Ploughs in its headlong fall the soil.
            While, as he stalks thro’ groaning oaks,
            At intervals the old deer croaks:
            And the lean sow with paps drawn dry
            O’er rustling leaves trots whining by.—

              Then posts across the blasted plain,
            Born on the wild storm, Witchcraft’s train,
            Aghast with guilt, and shrunk with age,
            And yelling with demoniack rage!—
            With eyes turn’d back malign and wide
            See blood-stain’d Murder silent stride,
            A moon-beam’s sudden light expands,
            He starts, and hides his crimson hands!—
            And now the cauldron gleams afar,
            Fir’d by a baneful meteor’s glare,
            Around they dance, they pause, and pour
            The mischiefs of the midnight hour;
            While trembling fiends with wonder gaze,
            Stretch their black wings, and fan the blaze!


                               PART, III.

           Ere Night withdraws her starry train,
           I print long traces o’er the plain,
           And bend my eyes to yon bright east
           To meet the Morning’s radiant guest,
           As o’er the hill his golden rays
           Burst thro’ the thicket in a blaze.
           Now from my foot the startled fawn
           Bounds to its parent on the lawn;
           And the wak’d lark exulting springs,
           Hangs high in air on quivering wings,
           Chaunts his loud transports o’er the heath,
           And eyes his list’ning loves beneath.

             Oft shall my TALBOT hither stray,
           And friendship give new joys to day;
           On him his blooming bride attend,
           Hither her graceful footsteps bend,
           Fresh life her brighter beauties fling
           O’er the young dawn, and blossom’d spring.

             They come! their eddying wheels resound,
           The harness’d coursers proudly bound,
           The light-hung chariot floats in air,
           And laughing Hymen wreaths the pair!
           As o’er the daisy’d lawns they move
           By glittering rill or dusky grove,
           Old NEEDWOOD calls his softest gale,
           Bids all his fragrant buds exhale:
           His gazing herds around them throng,
           His plighted birds suspend their song,
           Each on her urn his Naiads lean,
           And Wood-nymphs peep from allies green.

             Where this gay mount o’er-looks the wood,[12]
           Charm’d with the scene a monarch stood,
           Call’d these fair plains the richest gem,
           That deck’d his triple diadem,
           Awhile the cares of state forgot,
           And with it’s name adorn’d the spot.

             Down yon meridian fields afar
           When Mercia led her chiefs to war,
           Fell in one hour three monarchs brave,
           And LICHFIELD’S bower protects their grave.[13]
           Her stately spires amidst the skies
           Ting’d by the orient sun arise,
           With golden vanes invite the gale.—
           Triumphant ladies of the vale!

             Down yon mid-vale the british Nile,[14]
           Fair DOVE, comes winding many a mile;
           And from his copious urn distils
           The fatness of a thousand hills.
           Swell, generous river, leave thy banks,
           The thirsty soil shall give thee thanks!—
           The generous river swells, and leads
           His waters o’er impoverish’d meads,
           And lays his ample treasure down,
           Rich emblem of thy bounty, BROWN![15]

             Pleas’d on yon high abode I gaze,
           Whence C’ANDISH foaming Dove surveys:[16]
           And where those humbler vales extend
           Of thine, FITZHERBERT, chearful friend.[17]
           Or mark upon yon round ascent
           The social flag and open tent,[18]
           Where life’s smooth paths with sweets are strown,
           And mirth makes every hour it’s own.

             Where spreads this grove it’s umbrage wide
           Late the bold Outlaw fought and died.[19]
           Oft in it’s dark recess the oak
           Had fall’n beneath his secret stroke,
           Full many a deer the night’s dim ray
           Beheld his silent arrow slay,
           Deep furze conceal’d the fawns in vain,
           And lust of lucre thinn’d the plain.
           Here, by no power before controll’d,
           He met a forester as bold;
           O’er the fierce conflict frown’d the wood,
           And drank with thirsty roots his blood.

             Yon bank demands a pitying look,
           Where life a gentler breast forsook;[20]
           Sole comfort of an aged pair!
           The true-love of a damsel fair!—
           At prime of dawn he stepp’d away;
           Long was the journey, short the day;
           The wint’ry blast blew loud and chill;
           Night caught him on the unshelter’d hill;
           Fatigu’d he fell; no help came nigh;
           His faithful dog alone was by;
           Who, as he fondly lick’d his cheek,
           Heard his expiring master speak.
           “Heap not for me thy cottage-fire;
           “Cold grows my heart, unhappy sire!
           “But turn to my unfinish’d loom,
           “And weave the web, and bear it home!
           “Prepare not, dame, my evening meal;
           “But bid them ring my passing peal!
           “Deck not thyself, dear maid, to meet
           “Thy love; but bring his winding sheet!
           “I come not to your festive cheer;
           “Ye comrades, place me on my bier!—”
           —The morrow found him stiff and pale:
           Mournful the Muse recounts his tale.

             Her stately tower there HANBURY rears,
           Which proudly looks o’er distant shires;
           Down the chill slope and darken’d glade
           Projects afar it’s length of shade;
           Assails the skies with giant force,
           And checks the whirlwind in it’s course;
           Or, when black clouds involve the pole,
           Disarms the thunders, as they roll!—
           Beneath how Nature throws around
           Grand inequalities of ground,
           While down the dells and o’er the steeps
           The wavy line of Paphos creeps!—

             With awful sorrow I behold
           Yon cliff, that frowns with ruins old;[21]
           Stout FERRERS there kept faithless ward,[22]
           And GAUNT perform’d his Castle-guard.[23]
           There captive MARY look’d in vain[24]
           For NORFOLK, and her nuptial train;
           Enrich’d with royal tears the Dove,
           But sigh’d for freedom, not from love.
           ’Twas once the seat of festive state,
           Where high born dames and nobles sat;
           While minstrels, each in order heard,[25]
           Their venerable songs preferr’d.
           False memory of it’s state remains
           In the rude sport of brutal swains.[26]
           Now serpents hiss, and foxes dwell
           Amidst the mould’ring citadel;
           And time but spares those broken towers
           In mockery of human powers.

             Yon hill, that glows with southern rays,[27]
           All-conscious of superior praise,
           Swells her smooth top and pastures green,
           And of her sisters seems the queen;
           Proud from her ancient seats to trace
           The lineage of a generous race.
           “That generous race,” fair SUDBURY cries,
           “Is mine,” and bids her turrets rise,
           Lifts from the lap of peace her dome,
           Where finds Munificence a home;
           Then wide her shining lake she leads
           Through blossom’d groves and emerald meads,
           Cloaths with dark woods the distant scene,
           And pours her dappled herds between.
           —Ah me! what sudden sadness lowers
           O’er her fair front and vernal bowers!
           There sinks to her untimely tomb
           A virgin flower in beauty’s bloom!
           O thou wast all that youth admires,
           A parent loves, or friend desires!
           I knew thee well! my sorrowing heart
           Bears in thy loss a bitter part!—
           Whilst the sad Muse in plaintive verse
           Strews all her flowers around thy hearse,
           Let Pity quit thy grave, and go
           A mourner to yon house of woe.
           There from thy father’s bosom break
           Sighs, which too eloquently speak:
           Thy mother weeps, but weeps resign’d,
           In all things noble, most in mind:
           Pale griefs thy sisters’ cheeks invade;
           And one, alas, too tender maid!
           Holds a long melancholy strife
           Betwixt her sorrows and her life:
           Thy manly brothers strive to cure
           In vain, the pangs themselves endure.
           Fair Saint! a happier lot is thine
           Repos’d beneath the silent shrine!

             Now let me seek in pensive mood
           The rude recesses of the wood;
           And, where congenial gloom extends,
           Think of lost hopes and distant friends;
           Of scenes, whose pleasures fled too fast,
           And hours most valued now they’re past!

             Beside me lies a dingle deep,[28]
           With shaggy banks abrupt and steep;
           Through vistas wild my course I bend,
           Till day-light opens at the end:
           Where from intoxicating height
           Bursts the wide prospect on my sight.
           The terrace bold, on which I stand,
           Steps broad and forward on the land;
           Rude hills compose the side-long scene,
           With crofts and cottages between:
           The various landscape onward spreads
           O’er cultur’d plains and verdant meads;
           And seats, and towns, and hamlets rise,
           Where yon smoke curls into the skies,
           And spires, that pierce thro’ tufted trees;
           Till, faintly fading by degrees,
           Beyond, in wild confusion tost,
           The hills blue tops in clouds are lost.

             Yes, EATON-BANKS, in vain I strive[29]
           To hide the grief your oaks revive.—
           Bow thy tall branches, grateful wood!
           Afford me blossom, leaf, and bud!
           He, for whose memory these I blend,
           Thy late-lost master, was my friend!—
           Fall, gentle dews! fresh zephyrs, breathe!
           Spread, cooling shades! preserve my wreath!—
           Alas, it withers ere its time!—
           So faded he in manly prime!—
           But Virtue, scorning friendship’s aid,
           Rears her own palms, which never fade!
           _Needwood!_ if e’er my early voice
           Hath taught thy echoes to rejoice;
           If e’er my hounds in opening cry
           Have fill’d thy banks with ecstacy;
           If e’er array’d in cheerful green
           Our train hath deck’d thy wintry scene;
           Ere yet thy wood-wild walks I leave,
           My tributary verse receive:
           With thy own wreath my brows adorn,
           And to thy praises tune my horn!

             What green-rob’d Nymph, all loose her hair,
           With buskin’d leg, and bosom bare,
           Steps lightly down the turfy glades,
           And beckons tow’rd yon opening shades?—
           No harlot-form, dissembling guile
           With wanton air and painted smile,
           Lures to enchanted halls or bowers,
           Where festive Vice consumes his hours.
           Her mild and modest looks dispense
           The simple charm of innocence:
           And a sweet wildness in her eye
           Sparkles with young sincerity.—
           Lead on, fair guide, ere wakes the dawn,
           With thee I’ll climb the steepy lawn,
           With thee the leafy labyrinths trace,
           Where dwells the Genius of the place.—
           His large limbs press a prim-rose bed,
           A moss-grown root sustains his head,
           And, list’ning to a Druid’s rhimes,
           He bends his eye on distant times:
           While troops of sylvan Vassals meet
           To cast their garlands at his feet,
           And pipe and frisk in rings about,
           Or parly with the Hunter’s shout.
           And now a fragrant show’r he throws
           Of blossoms from his curled brows,
           And rising waves his oaken wand,
           And bids yon magic scenes expand!—

             First blush the hills with orient light,
           And pierce the sable veil of night,
           Green bends the waving shade above,
           And glist’ring dew-drops gem the grove:
           Next shine the shelving lawns around,
           Bright threads of silver net the ground;
           And down, the entangled brakes among,
           The white rill sparkling winds along:
           Then, as the pausing zephyrs breathe,
           The billowy mist recedes beneath;
           Slow, as it rolls away, unfold
           The vale’s fresh glories green and gold;
           DOVE[1] laughs, and shakes his tresses bright,
           And trails afar a line of light.

             Now glows the illumin’d landscape round!
           Ye Vulgar hence!—’tis sacred ground!
           Hence to the flimsy walks of art,
           That lull, but not transport the heart.
           Nature, O Muse, here sits alone,
           And marks these regions for thy own;
           Here her variety of joys
           Nor season bounds, nor change destroys:
           Be mine the pride, tho’ weak my strains,
           That first I woo’d thee to these plains;
           Where Spring, in all her beauty drest,
           But promises a brighter guest:
           Where Summer yields her greens and flowers
           To Autumn’s variegated bowers:
           Smiles Winter, as their honours fall,
           And bids his hollies shame them all.[2]

             Ye sage Professors of design,
           Whom system’s stubborn rules confine,
           Can science here one blemish show?
           Or one deficient grace bestow?
           EMES,[3] who yon desart wild explor’d,
           And to it’s name the scene restor’d;
           Whose art is nature’s law maintain’d,
           Whose order negligence restrain’d,
           Here, fir’d by native beauty, trac’d
           The foot-steps of the Goddess, Taste:
           Won from her coy retreats she came,
           And led him up these paths to fame.

             Here ev’ry flower improves the gale
           From the meek violet of the vale
           To her, who flaunts in air sublime,
           The woodbine, queen of summer’s prime:
           While each delicious shade may vie
           With those of boasted Arcady.
           There sweet varieties appear
           Of thickets, shap’d by nibbling Deer,
           Of hills, that swell with gradual ease,
           Wood-skirted lawns, and scatter’d trees;
           Of vallies seen down distant glades,
           That break the mass of mingling shades;
           While nature’s attribute, extent,
           Crowns each inferior ornament!—

             On this green unambitious brow,
           Fair Mistress of the vale below,
           With sloping hills enclos’d around,
           Their heads with oaks and hollies crown’d,
           With lucky choice, by happy hands,
           Plac’d in good hour, my dwelling stands;
           And draws the distant trav’ler’s eye,
           Enamour’d of it’s scenery;
           Where all things give, what all express,
           Content and rural happiness.
           Where far retir’d from life’s dull form
           Comes no intruder but the storm;
           The storm, that with contrasted low’r
           Endears the fair the silent hour.

             Thus their wise days our fathers led,
           Fleet ran their hounds, their arrows sped,
           And jocund Health with rosy smile
           Look’d on, companion of their toil:
           Till tyrant Law usurp’d the land,
           Stretch’d o’er the woods his iron hand,
           Forbad the echoing horn to blow,
           Maim’d the staunch hound, and snapp’d the bow.[4]

             Here with fair peace and modest fame[5]
           They dwelt, who boasted Bagot’s name,—
           Go, BAGOT, plead your country’s cause,
           While senates listen with applause,
           With fearless truth and manly sense
           Detecting specious eloquence:
           Great talents to the world are due,
           Retirement were a crime in you.
           Go, and receive your oaken crown!
           Here, with no title to renown,
           Leave me to loiter at my door
           Beneath the spreading sycamore,
           That canopies the sloping lawn;
           And view the deer at early dawn
           In troops come winding down the hill
           To taste fresh herbage near the rill;
           Or count at noon their slumb’ring heaps;
           At evening watch their playful leaps;
           Or hear the quiring of the grove
           Give breath to harmony and love;
           Or listen to the hum profound,
           In the still air that floats around;
           Or mark yon hills extended side,
           Where turf and shade the space divide;—
           Here the wood straggles tow’rd the plain,
           The pasture there prevails again;
           The heifer grazes on it’s brow,
           Clamours the rook on trees below;
           Gay golden furze and purple ling
           Around their mixt embroidery fling,
           O’er all, irregularly join’d,
           Th’ according outline waves behind.

             No dusky Cares o’er-hang the bower,
           No Passions wreck the halcyon hour;
           Nurs’d in the shade Reflection springs,
           Smooths her white plumes, and tries her wings.
           No leaf of autumn falls in vain;
           No flower-bell droops beneath the rain,
           No bubble down the current flows,
           But life’s uncertain tenure shows.
           Those thorns protect the forest’s hopes;
           That tree the slender ivy props:
           Thus rise the mighty on the mean!
           Thus on the strong the feeble lean!
           In yonder holly—blush mankind!—
           A rare fidelity I find;
           Like yours tho’ summer’s flatteries end,
           My winter here hath found a friend.—
           Hail faithful fav’rite tree! to you
           The Muse shall pay observance due:
           Whether in horrent files you stand
           Round sapling oaks a guardian band;
           Or form aloft a shelt’ring bower
           Impervious to the sun or shower;
           Whether to yon hill-side you throng
           Ranging in various groups along;
           Or on the plain, maturely grown,
           You boldly brave the storm alone,
           Or tapering high, with woodbines hid,
           Rise in a fragrant pyramid;
           Your vigorous youth with upright shoots,
           Your verdant age, your glowing fruits,
           Your glossy leaves, and columns gray
           Shall live the favorites of my lay!

             Alas! in vain with warmth and food
           You cheer the songsters of the wood,
           The barbarous boy from you prepares
           On treacherous twigs his viscous snares.
           Yes, the poor bird, you nurs’d, shall find
           Destruction in your rifled rind.
           Thus good and ill too often meet,
           And bitter mingles with the sweet!
           —Ye pedagogues! let truant youth
           Imbibe from you this gen’rous truth;
           That one humane, one tender thought
           Is worth the whole, that schools have taught.


                               PART, II.

            With what fond gaze my eye pursues,
            _NEEDWOOD_, thy sweetly-varying views!
            Satyr, or Nymph, or sylvan God
            A fairer circuit never trod!
            Charm’d, as I turn, thy pictures seem
            The golden fabricks of a dream.
            Where Fiction stands with prism bright,
            Rays forth her many-colour’d light,
            Dyes the green herb, and purple flower,
            Gives glittering lustres to the shower;
            Then gilds with livelier tints the sky,
            Or bends her radiant bow on high.

              To scenes so elegantly wild
            Fancy, of old, her darling child
            From AVON’S flowery margin brought,
            And ARDEN boasts what NEEDWOOD taught.[6]

              Such shades by mazy paths perplex’d,
            Where strays the traveller inly vex’d,
            Inspir’d the Muse of SPENCER’S pen;
            The _wandering wood_, and _Errors den_,[7]
            Dwarfs, Palfreys, Dames, and Giants rise
            Full on Imaginations eyes!
            See, See the Sarazin advance!
            The red-cross Knight hath couch’d his lance!
            They meet, the Christian wins the field,
            And bears away the _faithless_ shield![8]

              With such companions fond to rove,
            I venerate each hill and grove,
            To Phœbus as to Dian dear,
            And find a new Parnassus here.
            Here might the sacred sisters dwell
            By pebbly brook, or gushing well:
            O let me listen, as they sing,
            In some close vale beside a spring,
            Whose stream the intruding alder chides,
            Where the wild-bee her treasure hides!—
            Or sit in high imbowering shade
            With Contemplation, heav’n-ey’d maid,
            Where the scant sun through branches thin
            Chequers the dark green floor within;
            Where ev’ry leaf is wisdom’s page,
            And each gray trunk a hoary sage.
            Nor motion, human form, or noise
            This solemn pause of life destroys;
            Save where the playful squirrel bounds,
            Or ring-dove pours her plaintive sounds,
            Or lurking peasant lops an oak
            Restraining half his pilfering stroke,
            Or with his faggot stoops to rest
            Both by his years and burthen prest.

              Here, seen of old, the elfin race
            With sprightly vigils mark’d the place;
            Their gay processions charm’d the sight,
            Gilding the lucid noon of night;
            Or, when obscure the midnight hour,
            With glow-worm lantherns hung the bower.
            —Hark!—the soft lute! along the green
            Moves with majestic step the queen!
            Attendant Fays around her throng,
            And trace the dance or raise the song;
            Or touch the shrill reed, as they trip,
            With finger light and ruby lip.

              High, on her brow sublime, is born
            One scarlet wood-bine’s tremulous horn;
            A gaudy bee-bird’s triple plume[9]
            Sheds on her neck its waving gloom;
            With silvery gossamer entwin’d
            Stream the luxuriant locks behind.
            Thin folds of tangled network break
            In airy waves adown her neck:
            Warp’d in his loom, the spider spread
            The far-diverging rays of thread,
            Then round and round with shuttle fine
            Inwrought the undulating line.
            One rose-leaf forms her crimson vest,
            The loose edge crosses o’er her breast.
            And one translucent fold, which fell
            From the tall lily’s ample bell,
            Forms with sweet grace her snowy train,
            Flows, as she steps, and sweeps the plain.
            Silence and Night inchanted gaze,
            And Hesper hides his vanquish’d rays!—

              Now the wak’d reed-birds swell their throats,
            And night-larks trill their mingled notes:
            Yet hush’d in moss with writhed neck
            The black-bird hides his golden beak;
            Charm’d from his dream of love, he wakes,
            Opes his gay eye, his plumage shakes,
            And stretching wide each ebon wing,
            First in low whispers tries to sing;
            Then sounds his clarion loud, and thrills
            The moon-bright lawns, and shadowy hills.
            Silent the choral Fays attend,
            And then their silver voices blend,
            Each shining thread of sound prolong,
            And weave the magic woof of song.
            Pleas’d Philomela takes her stand
            On high, and leads the fairy band,
            Pours sweet at intervals her strain,
            And guides with beating wing the train.
            Whilst interrupted zephyrs bear
            Hoarse murmurs from the distant wear;
            And at each pause is heard the swell
            Of Echo’s soft symphonius shell.

              Nor the dread night my mind alarms,—
            NIGHT, and her horrors have their charms.
            O’er the wide forest oft I roam,
            What time the trav’ler, far from home,
            Bewilder’d in the pathless brakes,
            There his cold bed despairing makes;
            And hear the fox with savage bark
            Pay distant courtship through the dark;
            The owl with fault’ring voice unfold
            Her tale, like one who shakes with cold:
            And then the alarmed woods resound
            Th’ upbraidings of the well-train’d hound,
            Who with tremendous tongue arraigns
            And haunts the plunderer of his plains.
            So cries from earth the life-blood spilt,
            So waking furies harrass guilt!

              Oft have I through this solemn glade
            Of old dismember’d hollies stray’d,
            Whose bold bare rugged brows are seen
            Thrust through the mantling ever-green;
            Tall clustring columns here ascend,
            And there in gothic arches bend;[10]
            Whilst, as the silver moon-beams rise,
            Imagin’d temples strike my eyes,
            With tottering spire, and mouldering wall,
            And high roof nodding to its fall.—
            His lantern gleaming down the glade,
            One, like a sexton with his spade,[11]
            Comes from their caverns to exclude
            The mid-night prowlers of the wood.—
            Through fields of air while pausing slow,
            Yon death-bell tells the village woe!

              Born on her clouds when Darkness flings
            O’er the still air her raven wings,
            Ere yet the watery freight descends,
            While Heaven it’s purposes suspends,
            NIGHT, let me stand in silent trance,
            And watch the lightning’s kindling glance:
            While, stiff’ning at the imagin’d stroke,
            Appears behind a brighten’d oak,
            From justice fled to this wild place,
            A conscious robber’s gastly face!—
            Or fancy views with fear-fix’d eye
            A mangled spectre gliding by,
            Quick with the flash who seems to wave
            His pale hand, beck’ning to a grave!—
            And, as the fleeting vision dies,
            Loud thunders shake the closing skies.

              NIGHT, when rude blasts thy scenes deform,
            O place me in the perilous storm!
            While the moon labouring thro’ the clouds
            By turns her light reveals and shrouds;
            Torn from it’s trunk, when whirlwinds bear
            The twisted ash aloft in air:
            And some vast elm’s uprooted spoil
            Ploughs in its headlong fall the soil.
            While, as he stalks thro’ groaning oaks,
            At intervals the old deer croaks:
            And the lean sow with paps drawn dry
            O’er rustling leaves trots whining by.—

              Then posts across the blasted plain,
            Born on the wild storm, Witchcraft’s train,
            Aghast with guilt, and shrunk with age,
            And yelling with demoniack rage!—
            With eyes turn’d back malign and wide
            See blood-stain’d Murder silent stride,
            A moon-beam’s sudden light expands,
            He starts, and hides his crimson hands!—
            And now the cauldron gleams afar,
            Fir’d by a baneful meteor’s glare,
            Around they dance, they pause, and pour
            The mischiefs of the midnight hour;
            While trembling fiends with wonder gaze,
            Stretch their black wings, and fan the blaze!


                               PART, III.

           Ere Night withdraws her starry train,
           I print long traces o’er the plain,
           And bend my eyes to yon bright east
           To meet the Morning’s radiant guest,
           As o’er the hill his golden rays
           Burst thro’ the thicket in a blaze.
           Now from my foot the startled fawn
           Bounds to its parent on the lawn;
           And the wak’d lark exulting springs,
           Hangs high in air on quivering wings,
           Chaunts his loud transports o’er the heath,
           And eyes his list’ning loves beneath.

             Oft shall my TALBOT hither stray,
           And friendship give new joys to day;
           On him his blooming bride attend,
           Hither her graceful footsteps bend,
           Fresh life her brighter beauties fling
           O’er the young dawn, and blossom’d spring.

             They come! their eddying wheels resound,
           The harness’d coursers proudly bound,
           The light-hung chariot floats in air,
           And laughing Hymen wreaths the pair!
           As o’er the daisy’d lawns they move
           By glittering rill or dusky grove,
           Old NEEDWOOD calls his softest gale,
           Bids all his fragrant buds exhale:
           His gazing herds around them throng,
           His plighted birds suspend their song,
           Each on her urn his Naiads lean,
           And Wood-nymphs peep from allies green.

             Where this gay mount o’er-looks the wood,[12]
           Charm’d with the scene a monarch stood,
           Call’d these fair plains the richest gem,
           That deck’d his triple diadem,
           Awhile the cares of state forgot,
           And with it’s name adorn’d the spot.

             Down yon meridian fields afar
           When Mercia led her chiefs to war,
           Fell in one hour three monarchs brave,
           And LICHFIELD’S bower protects their grave.[13]
           Her stately spires amidst the skies
           Ting’d by the orient sun arise,
           With golden vanes invite the gale.—
           Triumphant ladies of the vale!

             Down yon mid-vale the british Nile,[14]
           Fair DOVE, comes winding many a mile;
           And from his copious urn distils
           The fatness of a thousand hills.
           Swell, generous river, leave thy banks,
           The thirsty soil shall give thee thanks!—
           The generous river swells, and leads
           His waters o’er impoverish’d meads,
           And lays his ample treasure down,
           Rich emblem of thy bounty, BROWN![15]

             Pleas’d on yon high abode I gaze,
           Whence C’ANDISH foaming Dove surveys:[16]
           And where those humbler vales extend
           Of thine, FITZHERBERT, chearful friend.[17]
           Or mark upon yon round ascent
           The social flag and open tent,[18]
           Where life’s smooth paths with sweets are strown,
           And mirth makes every hour it’s own.

             Where spreads this grove it’s umbrage wide
           Late the bold Outlaw fought and died.[19]
           Oft in it’s dark recess the oak
           Had fall’n beneath his secret stroke,
           Full many a deer the night’s dim ray
           Beheld his silent arrow slay,
           Deep furze conceal’d the fawns in vain,
           And lust of lucre thinn’d the plain.
           Here, by no power before controll’d,
           He met a forester as bold;
           O’er the fierce conflict frown’d the wood,
           And drank with thirsty roots his blood.

             Yon bank demands a pitying look,
           Where life a gentler breast forsook;[20]
           Sole comfort of an aged pair!
           The true-love of a damsel fair!—
           At prime of dawn he stepp’d away;
           Long was the journey, short the day;
           The wint’ry blast blew loud and chill;
           Night caught him on the unshelter’d hill;
           Fatigu’d he fell; no help came nigh;
           His faithful dog alone was by;
           Who, as he fondly lick’d his cheek,
           Heard his expiring master speak.
           “Heap not for me thy cottage-fire;
           “Cold grows my heart, unhappy sire!
           “But turn to my unfinish’d loom,
           “And weave the web, and bear it home!
           “Prepare not, dame, my evening meal;
           “But bid them ring my passing peal!
           “Deck not thyself, dear maid, to meet
           “Thy love; but bring his winding sheet!
           “I come not to your festive cheer;
           “Ye comrades, place me on my bier!—”
           —The morrow found him stiff and pale:
           Mournful the Muse recounts his tale.

             Her stately tower there HANBURY rears,
           Which proudly looks o’er distant shires;
           Down the chill slope and darken’d glade
           Projects afar it’s length of shade;
           Assails the skies with giant force,
           And checks the whirlwind in it’s course;
           Or, when black clouds involve the pole,
           Disarms the thunders, as they roll!—
           Beneath how Nature throws around
           Grand inequalities of ground,
           While down the dells and o’er the steeps
           The wavy line of Paphos creeps!—

             With awful sorrow I behold
           Yon cliff, that frowns with ruins old;[21]
           Stout FERRERS there kept faithless ward,[22]
           And GAUNT perform’d his Castle-guard.[23]
           There captive MARY look’d in vain[24]
           For NORFOLK, and her nuptial train;
           Enrich’d with royal tears the Dove,
           But sigh’d for freedom, not from love.
           ’Twas once the seat of festive state,
           Where high born dames and nobles sat;
           While minstrels, each in order heard,[25]
           Their venerable songs preferr’d.
           False memory of it’s state remains
           In the rude sport of brutal swains.[26]
           Now serpents hiss, and foxes dwell
           Amidst the mould’ring citadel;
           And time but spares those broken towers
           In mockery of human powers.

             Yon hill, that glows with southern rays,[27]
           All-conscious of superior praise,
           Swells her smooth top and pastures green,
           And of her sisters seems the queen;
           Proud from her ancient seats to trace
           The lineage of a generous race.
           “That generous race,” fair SUDBURY cries,
           “Is mine,” and bids her turrets rise,
           Lifts from the lap of peace her dome,
           Where finds Munificence a home;
           Then wide her shining lake she leads
           Through blossom’d groves and emerald meads,
           Cloaths with dark woods the distant scene,
           And pours her dappled herds between.
           —Ah me! what sudden sadness lowers
           O’er her fair front and vernal bowers!
           There sinks to her untimely tomb
           A virgin flower in beauty’s bloom!
           O thou wast all that youth admires,
           A parent loves, or friend desires!
           I knew thee well! my sorrowing heart
           Bears in thy loss a bitter part!—
           Whilst the sad Muse in plaintive verse
           Strews all her flowers around thy hearse,
           Let Pity quit thy grave, and go
           A mourner to yon house of woe.
           There from thy father’s bosom break
           Sighs, which too eloquently speak:
           Thy mother weeps, but weeps resign’d,
           In all things noble, most in mind:
           Pale griefs thy sisters’ cheeks invade;
           And one, alas, too tender maid!
           Holds a long melancholy strife
           Betwixt her sorrows and her life:
           Thy manly brothers strive to cure
           In vain, the pangs themselves endure.
           Fair Saint! a happier lot is thine
           Repos’d beneath the silent shrine!

             Now let me seek in pensive mood
           The rude recesses of the wood;
           And, where congenial gloom extends,
           Think of lost hopes and distant friends;
           Of scenes, whose pleasures fled too fast,
           And hours most valued now they’re past!

             Beside me lies a dingle deep,[28]
           With shaggy banks abrupt and steep;
           Through vistas wild my course I bend,
           Till day-light opens at the end:
           Where from intoxicating height
           Bursts the wide prospect on my sight.
           The terrace bold, on which I stand,
           Steps broad and forward on the land;
           Rude hills compose the side-long scene,
           With crofts and cottages between:
           The various landscape onward spreads
           O’er cultur’d plains and verdant meads;
           And seats, and towns, and hamlets rise,
           Where yon smoke curls into the skies,
           And spires, that pierce thro’ tufted trees;
           Till, faintly fading by degrees,
           Beyond, in wild confusion tost,
           The hills blue tops in clouds are lost.

             Yes, EATON-BANKS, in vain I strive[29]
           To hide the grief your oaks revive.—
           Bow thy tall branches, grateful wood!
           Afford me blossom, leaf, and bud!
           He, for whose memory these I blend,
           Thy late-lost master, was my friend!—
           Fall, gentle dews! fresh zephyrs, breathe!
           Spread, cooling shades! preserve my wreath!—
           Alas, it withers ere its time!—
           So faded he in manly prime!—
           But Virtue, scorning friendship’s aid,
           Rears her own palms, which never fade!
           _Needwood!_ if e’er my early voice
           Hath taught thy echoes to rejoice;
           If e’er my hounds in opening cry
           Have fill’d thy banks with ecstacy;
           If e’er array’d in cheerful green
           Our train hath deck’d thy wintry scene;
           Ere yet thy wood-wild walks I leave,
           My tributary verse receive:
           With thy own wreath my brows adorn,
           And to thy praises tune my horn!

             What green-rob’d Nymph, all loose her hair,
           With buskin’d leg, and bosom bare,
           Steps lightly down the turfy glades,
           And beckons tow’rd yon opening shades?—
           No harlot-form, dissembling guile
           With wanton air and painted smile,
           Lures to enchanted halls or bowers,
           Where festive Vice consumes his hours.
           Her mild and modest looks dispense
           The simple charm of innocence:
           And a sweet wildness in her eye
           Sparkles with young sincerity.—
           Lead on, fair guide, ere wakes the dawn,
           With thee I’ll climb the steepy lawn,
           With thee the leafy labyrinths trace,
           Where dwells the Genius of the place.—
           His large limbs press a prim-rose bed,
           A moss-grown root sustains his head,
           And, list’ning to a Druid’s rhimes,
           He bends his eye on distant times:
           While troops of sylvan Vassals meet
           To cast their garlands at his feet,
           And pipe and frisk in rings about,
           Or parly with the Hunter’s shout.
           And now a fragrant show’r he throws
           Of blossoms from his curled brows,
           And rising waves his oaken wand,
           And bids yon magic scenes expand!—

             First blush the hills with orient light,
           And pierce the sable veil of night,
           Green bends the waving shade above,
           And glist’ring dew-drops gem the grove:
           Next shine the shelving lawns around,
           Bright threads of silver net the ground;
           And down, the entangled brakes among,
           The white rill sparkling winds along:
           Then, as the pausing zephyrs breathe,
           The billowy mist recedes beneath;
           Slow, as it rolls away, unfold
           The vale’s fresh glories green and gold;
           DOVE[1] laughs, and shakes his tresses bright,
           And trails afar a line of light.

             Now glows the illumin’d landscape round!
           Ye Vulgar hence!—’tis sacred ground!
           Hence to the flimsy walks of art,
           That lull, but not transport the heart.
           Nature, O Muse, here sits alone,
           And marks these regions for thy own;
           Here her variety of joys
           Nor season bounds, nor change destroys:
           Be mine the pride, tho’ weak my strains,
           That first I woo’d thee to these plains;
           Where Spring, in all her beauty drest,
           But promises a brighter guest:
           Where Summer yields her greens and flowers
           To Autumn’s variegated bowers:
           Smiles Winter, as their honours fall,
           And bids his hollies shame them all.[2]

             Ye sage Professors of design,
           Whom system’s stubborn rules confine,
           Can science here one blemish show?
           Or one deficient grace bestow?
           EMES,[3] who yon desart wild explor’d,
           And to it’s name the scene restor’d;
           Whose art is nature’s law maintain’d,
           Whose order negligence restrain’d,
           Here, fir’d by native beauty, trac’d
           The foot-steps of the Goddess, Taste:
           Won from her coy retreats she came,
           And led him up these paths to fame.

             Here ev’ry flower improves the gale
           From the meek violet of the vale
           To her, who flaunts in air sublime,
           The woodbine, queen of summer’s prime:
           While each delicious shade may vie
           With those of boasted Arcady.
           There sweet varieties appear
           Of thickets, shap’d by nibbling Deer,
           Of hills, that swell with gradual ease,
           Wood-skirted lawns, and scatter’d trees;
           Of vallies seen down distant glades,
           That break the mass of mingling shades;
           While nature’s attribute, extent,
           Crowns each inferior ornament!—

             On this green unambitious brow,
           Fair Mistress of the vale below,
           With sloping hills enclos’d around,
           Their heads with oaks and hollies crown’d,
           With lucky choice, by happy hands,
           Plac’d in good hour, my dwelling stands;
           And draws the distant trav’ler’s eye,
           Enamour’d of it’s scenery;
           Where all things give, what all express,
           Content and rural happiness.
           Where far retir’d from life’s dull form
           Comes no intruder but the storm;
           The storm, that with contrasted low’r
           Endears the fair the silent hour.

             Thus their wise days our fathers led,
           Fleet ran their hounds, their arrows sped,
           And jocund Health with rosy smile
           Look’d on, companion of their toil:
           Till tyrant Law usurp’d the land,
           Stretch’d o’er the woods his iron hand,
           Forbad the echoing horn to blow,
           Maim’d the staunch hound, and snapp’d the bow.[4]

             Here with fair peace and modest fame[5]
           They dwelt, who boasted Bagot’s name,—
           Go, BAGOT, plead your country’s cause,
           While senates listen with applause,
           With fearless truth and manly sense
           Detecting specious eloquence:
           Great talents to the world are due,
           Retirement were a crime in you.
           Go, and receive your oaken crown!
           Here, with no title to renown,
           Leave me to loiter at my door
           Beneath the spreading sycamore,
           That canopies the sloping lawn;
           And view the deer at early dawn
           In troops come winding down the hill
           To taste fresh herbage near the rill;
           Or count at noon their slumb’ring heaps;
           At evening watch their playful leaps;
           Or hear the quiring of the grove
           Give breath to harmony and love;
           Or listen to the hum profound,
           In the still air that floats around;
           Or mark yon hills extended side,
           Where turf and shade the space divide;—
           Here the wood straggles tow’rd the plain,
           The pasture there prevails again;
           The heifer grazes on it’s brow,
           Clamours the rook on trees below;
           Gay golden furze and purple ling
           Around their mixt embroidery fling,
           O’er all, irregularly join’d,
           Th’ according outline waves behind.

             No dusky Cares o’er-hang the bower,
           No Passions wreck the halcyon hour;
           Nurs’d in the shade Reflection springs,
           Smooths her white plumes, and tries her wings.
           No leaf of autumn falls in vain;
           No flower-bell droops beneath the rain,
           No bubble down the current flows,
           But life’s uncertain tenure shows.
           Those thorns protect the forest’s hopes;
           That tree the slender ivy props:
           Thus rise the mighty on the mean!
           Thus on the strong the feeble lean!
           In yonder holly—blush mankind!—
           A rare fidelity I find;
           Like yours tho’ summer’s flatteries end,
           My winter here hath found a friend.—
           Hail faithful fav’rite tree! to you
           The Muse shall pay observance due:
           Whether in horrent files you stand
           Round sapling oaks a guardian band;
           Or form aloft a shelt’ring bower
           Impervious to the sun or shower;
           Whether to yon hill-side you throng
           Ranging in various groups along;
           Or on the plain, maturely grown,
           You boldly brave the storm alone,
           Or tapering high, with woodbines hid,
           Rise in a fragrant pyramid;
           Your vigorous youth with upright shoots,
           Your verdant age, your glowing fruits,
           Your glossy leaves, and columns gray
           Shall live the favorites of my lay!

             Alas! in vain with warmth and food
           You cheer the songsters of the wood,
           The barbarous boy from you prepares
           On treacherous twigs his viscous snares.
           Yes, the poor bird, you nurs’d, shall find
           Destruction in your rifled rind.
           Thus good and ill too often meet,
           And bitter mingles with the sweet!
           —Ye pedagogues! let truant youth
           Imbibe from you this gen’rous truth;
           That one humane, one tender thought
           Is worth the whole, that schools have taught.


                               PART, II.

            With what fond gaze my eye pursues,
            _NEEDWOOD_, thy sweetly-varying views!
            Satyr, or Nymph, or sylvan God
            A fairer circuit never trod!
            Charm’d, as I turn, thy pictures seem
            The golden fabricks of a dream.
            Where Fiction stands with prism bright,
            Rays forth her many-colour’d light,
            Dyes the green herb, and purple flower,
            Gives glittering lustres to the shower;
            Then gilds with livelier tints the sky,
            Or bends her radiant bow on high.

              To scenes so elegantly wild
            Fancy, of old, her darling child
            From AVON’S flowery margin brought,
            And ARDEN boasts what NEEDWOOD taught.[6]

              Such shades by mazy paths perplex’d,
            Where strays the traveller inly vex’d,
            Inspir’d the Muse of SPENCER’S pen;
            The _wandering wood_, and _Errors den_,[7]
            Dwarfs, Palfreys, Dames, and Giants rise
            Full on Imaginations eyes!
            See, See the Sarazin advance!
            The red-cross Knight hath couch’d his lance!
            They meet, the Christian wins the field,
            And bears away the _faithless_ shield![8]

              With such companions fond to rove,
            I venerate each hill and grove,
            To Phœbus as to Dian dear,
            And find a new Parnassus here.
            Here might the sacred sisters dwell
            By pebbly brook, or gushing well:
            O let me listen, as they sing,
            In some close vale beside a spring,
            Whose stream the intruding alder chides,
            Where the wild-bee her treasure hides!—
            Or sit in high imbowering shade
            With Contemplation, heav’n-ey’d maid,
            Where the scant sun through branches thin
            Chequers the dark green floor within;
            Where ev’ry leaf is wisdom’s page,
            And each gray trunk a hoary sage.
            Nor motion, human form, or noise
            This solemn pause of life destroys;
            Save where the playful squirrel bounds,
            Or ring-dove pours her plaintive sounds,
            Or lurking peasant lops an oak
            Restraining half his pilfering stroke,
            Or with his faggot stoops to rest
            Both by his years and burthen prest.

              Here, seen of old, the elfin race
            With sprightly vigils mark’d the place;
            Their gay processions charm’d the sight,
            Gilding the lucid noon of night;
            Or, when obscure the midnight hour,
            With glow-worm lantherns hung the bower.
            —Hark!—the soft lute! along the green
            Moves with majestic step the queen!
            Attendant Fays around her throng,
            And trace the dance or raise the song;
            Or touch the shrill reed, as they trip,
            With finger light and ruby lip.

              High, on her brow sublime, is born
            One scarlet wood-bine’s tremulous horn;
            A gaudy bee-bird’s triple plume[9]
            Sheds on her neck its waving gloom;
            With silvery gossamer entwin’d
            Stream the luxuriant locks behind.
            Thin folds of tangled network break
            In airy waves adown her neck:
            Warp’d in his loom, the spider spread
            The far-diverging rays of thread,
            Then round and round with shuttle fine
            Inwrought the undulating line.
            One rose-leaf forms her crimson vest,
            The loose edge crosses o’er her breast.
            And one translucent fold, which fell
            From the tall lily’s ample bell,
            Forms with sweet grace her snowy train,
            Flows, as she steps, and sweeps the plain.
            Silence and Night inchanted gaze,
            And Hesper hides his vanquish’d rays!—

              Now the wak’d reed-birds swell their throats,
            And night-larks trill their mingled notes:
            Yet hush’d in moss with writhed neck
            The black-bird hides his golden beak;
            Charm’d from his dream of love, he wakes,
            Opes his gay eye, his plumage shakes,
            And stretching wide each ebon wing,
            First in low whispers tries to sing;
            Then sounds his clarion loud, and thrills
            The moon-bright lawns, and shadowy hills.
            Silent the choral Fays attend,
            And then their silver voices blend,
            Each shining thread of sound prolong,
            And weave the magic woof of song.
            Pleas’d Philomela takes her stand
            On high, and leads the fairy band,
            Pours sweet at intervals her strain,
            And guides with beating wing the train.
            Whilst interrupted zephyrs bear
            Hoarse murmurs from the distant wear;
            And at each pause is heard the swell
            Of Echo’s soft symphonius shell.

              Nor the dread night my mind alarms,—
            NIGHT, and her horrors have their charms.
            O’er the wide forest oft I roam,
            What time the trav’ler, far from home,
            Bewilder’d in the pathless brakes,
            There his cold bed despairing makes;
            And hear the fox with savage bark
            Pay distant courtship through the dark;
            The owl with fault’ring voice unfold
            Her tale, like one who shakes with cold:
            And then the alarmed woods resound
            Th’ upbraidings of the well-train’d hound,
            Who with tremendous tongue arraigns
            And haunts the plunderer of his plains.
            So cries from earth the life-blood spilt,
            So waking furies harrass guilt!

              Oft have I through this solemn glade
            Of old dismember’d hollies stray’d,
            Whose bold bare rugged brows are seen
            Thrust through the mantling ever-green;
            Tall clustring columns here ascend,
            And there in gothic arches bend;[10]
            Whilst, as the silver moon-beams rise,
            Imagin’d temples strike my eyes,
            With tottering spire, and mouldering wall,
            And high roof nodding to its fall.—
            His lantern gleaming down the glade,
            One, like a sexton with his spade,[11]
            Comes from their caverns to exclude
            The mid-night prowlers of the wood.—
            Through fields of air while pausing slow,
            Yon death-bell tells the village woe!

              Born on her clouds when Darkness flings
            O’er the still air her raven wings,
            Ere yet the watery freight descends,
            While Heaven it’s purposes suspends,
            NIGHT, let me stand in silent trance,
            And watch the lightning’s kindling glance:
            While, stiff’ning at the imagin’d stroke,
            Appears behind a brighten’d oak,
            From justice fled to this wild place,
            A conscious robber’s gastly face!—
            Or fancy views with fear-fix’d eye
            A mangled spectre gliding by,
            Quick with the flash who seems to wave
            His pale hand, beck’ning to a grave!—
            And, as the fleeting vision dies,
            Loud thunders shake the closing skies.

              NIGHT, when rude blasts thy scenes deform,
            O place me in the perilous storm!
            While the moon labouring thro’ the clouds
            By turns her light reveals and shrouds;
            Torn from it’s trunk, when whirlwinds bear
            The twisted ash aloft in air:
            And some vast elm’s uprooted spoil
            Ploughs in its headlong fall the soil.
            While, as he stalks thro’ groaning oaks,
            At intervals the old deer croaks:
            And the lean sow with paps drawn dry
            O’er rustling leaves trots whining by.—

              Then posts across the blasted plain,
            Born on the wild storm, Witchcraft’s train,
            Aghast with guilt, and shrunk with age,
            And yelling with demoniack rage!—
            With eyes turn’d back malign and wide
            See blood-stain’d Murder silent stride,
            A moon-beam’s sudden light expands,
            He starts, and hides his crimson hands!—
            And now the cauldron gleams afar,
            Fir’d by a baneful meteor’s glare,
            Around they dance, they pause, and pour
            The mischiefs of the midnight hour;
            While trembling fiends with wonder gaze,
            Stretch their black wings, and fan the blaze!


                               PART, III.

           Ere Night withdraws her starry train,
           I print long traces o’er the plain,
           And bend my eyes to yon bright east
           To meet the Morning’s radiant guest,
           As o’er the hill his golden rays
           Burst thro’ the thicket in a blaze.
           Now from my foot the startled fawn
           Bounds to its parent on the lawn;
           And the wak’d lark exulting springs,
           Hangs high in air on quivering wings,
           Chaunts his loud transports o’er the heath,
           And eyes his list’ning loves beneath.

             Oft shall my TALBOT hither stray,
           And friendship give new joys to day;
           On him his blooming bride attend,
           Hither her graceful footsteps bend,
           Fresh life her brighter beauties fling
           O’er the young dawn, and blossom’d spring.

             They come! their eddying wheels resound,
           The harness’d coursers proudly bound,
           The light-hung chariot floats in air,
           And laughing Hymen wreaths the pair!
           As o’er the daisy’d lawns they move
           By glittering rill or dusky grove,
           Old NEEDWOOD calls his softest gale,
           Bids all his fragrant buds exhale:
           His gazing herds around them throng,
           His plighted birds suspend their song,
           Each on her urn his Naiads lean,
           And Wood-nymphs peep from allies green.

             Where this gay mount o’er-looks the wood,[12]
           Charm’d with the scene a monarch stood,
           Call’d these fair plains the richest gem,
           That deck’d his triple diadem,
           Awhile the cares of state forgot,
           And with it’s name adorn’d the spot.

             Down yon meridian fields afar
           When Mercia led her chiefs to war,
           Fell in one hour three monarchs brave,
           And LICHFIELD’S bower protects their grave.[13]
           Her stately spires amidst the skies
           Ting’d by the orient sun arise,
           With golden vanes invite the gale.—
           Triumphant ladies of the vale!

             Down yon mid-vale the british Nile,[14]
           Fair DOVE, comes winding many a mile;
           And from his copious urn distils
           The fatness of a thousand hills.
           Swell, generous river, leave thy banks,
           The thirsty soil shall give thee thanks!—
           The generous river swells, and leads
           His waters o’er impoverish’d meads,
           And lays his ample treasure down,
           Rich emblem of thy bounty, BROWN![15]

             Pleas’d on yon high abode I gaze,
           Whence C’ANDISH foaming Dove surveys:[16]
           And where those humbler vales extend
           Of thine, FITZHERBERT, chearful friend.[17]
           Or mark upon yon round ascent
           The social flag and open tent,[18]
           Where life’s smooth paths with sweets are strown,
           And mirth makes every hour it’s own.

             Where spreads this grove it’s umbrage wide
           Late the bold Outlaw fought and died.[19]
           Oft in it’s dark recess the oak
           Had fall’n beneath his secret stroke,
           Full many a deer the night’s dim ray
           Beheld his silent arrow slay,
           Deep furze conceal’d the fawns in vain,
           And lust of lucre thinn’d the plain.
           Here, by no power before controll’d,
           He met a forester as bold;
           O’er the fierce conflict frown’d the wood,
           And drank with thirsty roots his blood.

             Yon bank demands a pitying look,
           Where life a gentler breast forsook;[20]
           Sole comfort of an aged pair!
           The true-love of a damsel fair!—
           At prime of dawn he stepp’d away;
           Long was the journey, short the day;
           The wint’ry blast blew loud and chill;
           Night caught him on the unshelter’d hill;
           Fatigu’d he fell; no help came nigh;
           His faithful dog alone was by;
           Who, as he fondly lick’d his cheek,
           Heard his expiring master speak.
           “Heap not for me thy cottage-fire;
           “Cold grows my heart, unhappy sire!
           “But turn to my unfinish’d loom,
           “And weave the web, and bear it home!
           “Prepare not, dame, my evening meal;
           “But bid them ring my passing peal!
           “Deck not thyself, dear maid, to meet
           “Thy love; but bring his winding sheet!
           “I come not to your festive cheer;
           “Ye comrades, place me on my bier!—”
           —The morrow found him stiff and pale:
           Mournful the Muse recounts his tale.

             Her stately tower there HANBURY rears,
           Which proudly looks o’er distant shires;
           Down the chill slope and darken’d glade
           Projects afar it’s length of shade;
           Assails the skies with giant force,
           And checks the whirlwind in it’s course;
           Or, when black clouds involve the pole,
           Disarms the thunders, as they roll!—
           Beneath how Nature throws around
           Grand inequalities of ground,
           While down the dells and o’er the steeps
           The wavy line of Paphos creeps!—

             With awful sorrow I behold
           Yon cliff, that frowns with ruins old;[21]
           Stout FERRERS there kept faithless ward,[22]
           And GAUNT perform’d his Castle-guard.[23]
           There captive MARY look’d in vain[24]
           For NORFOLK, and her nuptial train;
           Enrich’d with royal tears the Dove,
           But sigh’d for freedom, not from love.
           ’Twas once the seat of festive state,
           Where high born dames and nobles sat;
           While minstrels, each in order heard,[25]
           Their venerable songs preferr’d.
           False memory of it’s state remains
           In the rude sport of brutal swains.[26]
           Now serpents hiss, and foxes dwell
           Amidst the mould’ring citadel;
           And time but spares those broken towers
           In mockery of human powers.

             Yon hill, that glows with southern rays,[27]
           All-conscious of superior praise,
           Swells her smooth top and pastures green,
           And of her sisters seems the queen;
           Proud from her ancient seats to trace
           The lineage of a generous race.
           “That generous race,” fair SUDBURY cries,
           “Is mine,” and bids her turrets rise,
           Lifts from the lap of peace her dome,
           Where finds Munificence a home;
           Then wide her shining lake she leads
           Through blossom’d groves and emerald meads,
           Cloaths with dark woods the distant scene,
           And pours her dappled herds between.
           —Ah me! what sudden sadness lowers
           O’er her fair front and vernal bowers!
           There sinks to her untimely tomb
           A virgin flower in beauty’s bloom!
           O thou wast all that youth admires,
           A parent loves, or friend desires!
           I knew thee well! my sorrowing heart
           Bears in thy loss a bitter part!—
           Whilst the sad Muse in plaintive verse
           Strews all her flowers around thy hearse,
           Let Pity quit thy grave, and go
           A mourner to yon house of woe.
           There from thy father’s bosom break
           Sighs, which too eloquently speak:
           Thy mother weeps, but weeps resign’d,
           In all things noble, most in mind:
           Pale griefs thy sisters’ cheeks invade;
           And one, alas, too tender maid!
           Holds a long melancholy strife
           Betwixt her sorrows and her life:
           Thy manly brothers strive to cure
           In vain, the pangs themselves endure.
           Fair Saint! a happier lot is thine
           Repos’d beneath the silent shrine!

             Now let me seek in pensive mood
           The rude recesses of the wood;
           And, where congenial gloom extends,
           Think of lost hopes and distant friends;
           Of scenes, whose pleasures fled too fast,
           And hours most valued now they’re past!

             Beside me lies a dingle deep,[28]
           With shaggy banks abrupt and steep;
           Through vistas wild my course I bend,
           Till day-light opens at the end:
           Where from intoxicating height
           Bursts the wide prospect on my sight.
           The terrace bold, on which I stand,
           Steps broad and forward on the land;
           Rude hills compose the side-long scene,
           With crofts and cottages between:
           The various landscape onward spreads
           O’er cultur’d plains and verdant meads;
           And seats, and towns, and hamlets rise,
           Where yon smoke curls into the skies,
           And spires, that pierce thro’ tufted trees;
           Till, faintly fading by degrees,
           Beyond, in wild confusion tost,
           The hills blue tops in clouds are lost.

             Yes, EATON-BANKS, in vain I strive[29]
           To hide the grief your oaks revive.—
           Bow thy tall branches, grateful wood!
           Afford me blossom, leaf, and bud!
           He, for whose memory these I blend,
           Thy late-lost master, was my friend!—
           Fall, gentle dews! fresh zephyrs, breathe!
           Spread, cooling shades! preserve my wreath!—
           Alas, it withers ere its time!—
           So faded he in manly prime!—
           But Virtue, scorning friendship’s aid,
           Rears her own palms, which never fade!
           _Needwood!_ if e’er my early voice
           Hath taught thy echoes to rejoice;
           If e’er my hounds in opening cry
           Have fill’d thy banks with ecstacy;
           If e’er array’d in cheerful green
           Our train hath deck’d thy wintry scene;
           Ere yet thy wood-wild walks I leave,
           My tributary verse receive:
           With thy own wreath my brows adorn,
           And to thy praises tune my horn!

             What green-rob’d Nymph, all loose her hair,
           With buskin’d leg, and bosom bare,
           Steps lightly down the turfy glades,
           And beckons tow’rd yon opening shades?—
           No harlot-form, dissembling guile
           With wanton air and painted smile,
           Lures to enchanted halls or bowers,
           Where festive Vice consumes his hours.
           Her mild and modest looks dispense
           The simple charm of innocence:
           And a sweet wildness in her eye
           Sparkles with young sincerity.—
           Lead on, fair guide, ere wakes the dawn,
           With thee I’ll climb the steepy lawn,
           With thee the leafy labyrinths trace,
           Where dwells the Genius of the place.—
           His large limbs press a prim-rose bed,
           A moss-grown root sustains his head,
           And, list’ning to a Druid’s rhimes,
           He bends his eye on distant times:
           While troops of sylvan Vassals meet
           To cast their garlands at his feet,
           And pipe and frisk in rings about,
           Or parly with the Hunter’s shout.
           And now a fragrant show’r he throws
           Of blossoms from his curled brows,
           And rising waves his oaken wand,
           And bids yon magic scenes expand!—

             First blush the hills with orient light,
           And pierce the sable veil of night,
           Green bends the waving shade above,
           And glist’ring dew-drops gem the grove:
           Next shine the shelving lawns around,
           Bright threads of silver net the ground;
           And down, the entangled brakes among,
           The white rill sparkling winds along:
           Then, as the pausing zephyrs breathe,
           The billowy mist recedes beneath;
           Slow, as it rolls away, unfold
           The vale’s fresh glories green and gold;
           DOVE[1] laughs, and shakes his tresses bright,
           And trails afar a line of light.

             Now glows the illumin’d landscape round!
           Ye Vulgar hence!—’tis sacred ground!
           Hence to the flimsy walks of art,
           That lull, but not transport the heart.
           Nature, O Muse, here sits alone,
           And marks these regions for thy own;
           Here her variety of joys
           Nor season bounds, nor change destroys:
           Be mine the pride, tho’ weak my strains,
           That first I woo’d thee to these plains;
           Where Spring, in all her beauty drest,
           But promises a brighter guest:
           Where Summer yields her greens and flowers
           To Autumn’s variegated bowers:
           Smiles Winter, as their honours fall,
           And bids his hollies shame them all.[2]

             Ye sage Professors of design,
           Whom system’s stubborn rules confine,
           Can science here one blemish show?
           Or one deficient grace bestow?
           EMES,[3] who yon desart wild explor’d,
           And to it’s name the scene restor’d;
           Whose art is nature’s law maintain’d,
           Whose order negligence restrain’d,
           Here, fir’d by native beauty, trac’d
           The foot-steps of the Goddess, Taste:
           Won from her coy retreats she came,
           And led him up these paths to fame.

             Here ev’ry flower improves the gale
           From the meek violet of the vale
           To her, who flaunts in air sublime,
           The woodbine, queen of summer’s prime:
           While each delicious shade may vie
           With those of boasted Arcady.
           There sweet varieties appear
           Of thickets, shap’d by nibbling Deer,
           Of hills, that swell with gradual ease,
           Wood-skirted lawns, and scatter’d trees;
           Of vallies seen down distant glades,
           That break the mass of mingling shades;
           While nature’s attribute, extent,
           Crowns each inferior ornament!—

             On this green unambitious brow,
           Fair Mistress of the vale below,
           With sloping hills enclos’d around,
           Their heads with oaks and hollies crown’d,
           With lucky choice, by happy hands,
           Plac’d in good hour, my dwelling stands;
           And draws the distant trav’ler’s eye,
           Enamour’d of it’s scenery;
           Where all things give, what all express,
           Content and rural happiness.
           Where far retir’d from life’s dull form
           Comes no intruder but the storm;
           The storm, that with contrasted low’r
           Endears the fair the silent hour.

             Thus their wise days our fathers led,
           Fleet ran their hounds, their arrows sped,
           And jocund Health with rosy smile
           Look’d on, companion of their toil:
           Till tyrant Law usurp’d the land,
           Stretch’d o’er the woods his iron hand,
           Forbad the echoing horn to blow,
           Maim’d the staunch hound, and snapp’d the bow.[4]

             Here with fair peace and modest fame[5]
           They dwelt, who boasted Bagot’s name,—
           Go, BAGOT, plead your country’s cause,
           While senates listen with applause,
           With fearless truth and manly sense
           Detecting specious eloquence:
           Great talents to the world are due,
           Retirement were a crime in you.
           Go, and receive your oaken crown!
           Here, with no title to renown,
           Leave me to loiter at my door
           Beneath the spreading sycamore,
           That canopies the sloping lawn;
           And view the deer at early dawn
           In troops come winding down the hill
           To taste fresh herbage near the rill;
           Or count at noon their slumb’ring heaps;
           At evening watch their playful leaps;
           Or hear the quiring of the grove
           Give breath to harmony and love;
           Or listen to the hum profound,
           In the still air that floats around;
           Or mark yon hills extended side,
           Where turf and shade the space divide;—
           Here the wood straggles tow’rd the plain,
           The pasture there prevails again;
           The heifer grazes on it’s brow,
           Clamours the rook on trees below;
           Gay golden furze and purple ling
           Around their mixt embroidery fling,
           O’er all, irregularly join’d,
           Th’ according outline waves behind.

             No dusky Cares o’er-hang the bower,
           No Passions wreck the halcyon hour;
           Nurs’d in the shade Reflection springs,
           Smooths her white plumes, and tries her wings.
           No leaf of autumn falls in vain;
           No flower-bell droops beneath the rain,
           No bubble down the current flows,
           But life’s uncertain tenure shows.
           Those thorns protect the forest’s hopes;
           That tree the slender ivy props:
           Thus rise the mighty on the mean!
           Thus on the strong the feeble lean!
           In yonder holly—blush mankind!—
           A rare fidelity I find;
           Like yours tho’ summer’s flatteries end,
           My winter here hath found a friend.—
           Hail faithful fav’rite tree! to you
           The Muse shall pay observance due:
           Whether in horrent files you stand
           Round sapling oaks a guardian band;
           Or form aloft a shelt’ring bower
           Impervious to the sun or shower;
           Whether to yon hill-side you throng
           Ranging in various groups along;
           Or on the plain, maturely grown,
           You boldly brave the storm alone,
           Or tapering high, with woodbines hid,
           Rise in a fragrant pyramid;
           Your vigorous youth with upright shoots,
           Your verdant age, your glowing fruits,
           Your glossy leaves, and columns gray
           Shall live the favorites of my lay!

             Alas! in vain with warmth and food
           You cheer the songsters of the wood,
           The barbarous boy from you prepares
           On treacherous twigs his viscous snares.
           Yes, the poor bird, you nurs’d, shall find
           Destruction in your rifled rind.
           Thus good and ill too often meet,
           And bitter mingles with the sweet!
           —Ye pedagogues! let truant youth
           Imbibe from you this gen’rous truth;
           That one humane, one tender thought
           Is worth the whole, that schools have taught.


                               PART, II.

            With what fond gaze my eye pursues,
            _NEEDWOOD_, thy sweetly-varying views!
            Satyr, or Nymph, or sylvan God
            A fairer circuit never trod!
            Charm’d, as I turn, thy pictures seem
            The golden fabricks of a dream.
            Where Fiction stands with prism bright,
            Rays forth her many-colour’d light,
            Dyes the green herb, and purple flower,
            Gives glittering lustres to the shower;
            Then gilds with livelier tints the sky,
            Or bends her radiant bow on high.

              To scenes so elegantly wild
            Fancy, of old, her darling child
            From AVON’S flowery margin brought,
            And ARDEN boasts what NEEDWOOD taught.[6]

              Such shades by mazy paths perplex’d,
            Where strays the traveller inly vex’d,
            Inspir’d the Muse of SPENCER’S pen;
            The _wandering wood_, and _Errors den_,[7]
            Dwarfs, Palfreys, Dames, and Giants rise
            Full on Imaginations eyes!
            See, See the Sarazin advance!
            The red-cross Knight hath couch’d his lance!
            They meet, the Christian wins the field,
            And bears away the _faithless_ shield![8]

              With such companions fond to rove,
            I venerate each hill and grove,
            To Phœbus as to Dian dear,
            And find a new Parnassus here.
            Here might the sacred sisters dwell
            By pebbly brook, or gushing well:
            O let me listen, as they sing,
            In some close vale beside a spring,
            Whose stream the intruding alder chides,
            Where the wild-bee her treasure hides!—
            Or sit in high imbowering shade
            With Contemplation, heav’n-ey’d maid,
            Where the scant sun through branches thin
            Chequers the dark green floor within;
            Where ev’ry leaf is wisdom’s page,
            And each gray trunk a hoary sage.
            Nor motion, human form, or noise
            This solemn pause of life destroys;
            Save where the playful squirrel bounds,
            Or ring-dove pours her plaintive sounds,
            Or lurking peasant lops an oak
            Restraining half his pilfering stroke,
            Or with his faggot stoops to rest
            Both by his years and burthen prest.

              Here, seen of old, the elfin race
            With sprightly vigils mark’d the place;
            Their gay processions charm’d the sight,
            Gilding the lucid noon of night;
            Or, when obscure the midnight hour,
            With glow-worm lantherns hung the bower.
            —Hark!—the soft lute! along the green
            Moves with majestic step the queen!
            Attendant Fays around her throng,
            And trace the dance or raise the song;
            Or touch the shrill reed, as they trip,
            With finger light and ruby lip.

              High, on her brow sublime, is born
            One scarlet wood-bine’s tremulous horn;
            A gaudy bee-bird’s triple plume[9]
            Sheds on her neck its waving gloom;
            With silvery gossamer entwin’d
            Stream the luxuriant locks behind.
            Thin folds of tangled network break
            In airy waves adown her neck:
            Warp’d in his loom, the spider spread
            The far-diverging rays of thread,
            Then round and round with shuttle fine
            Inwrought the undulating line.
            One rose-leaf forms her crimson vest,
            The loose edge crosses o’er her breast.
            And one translucent fold, which fell
            From the tall lily’s ample bell,
            Forms with sweet grace her snowy train,
            Flows, as she steps, and sweeps the plain.
            Silence and Night inchanted gaze,
            And Hesper hides his vanquish’d rays!—

              Now the wak’d reed-birds swell their throats,
            And night-larks trill their mingled notes:
            Yet hush’d in moss with writhed neck
            The black-bird hides his golden beak;
            Charm’d from his dream of love, he wakes,
            Opes his gay eye, his plumage shakes,
            And stretching wide each ebon wing,
            First in low whispers tries to sing;
            Then sounds his clarion loud, and thrills
            The moon-bright lawns, and shadowy hills.
            Silent the choral Fays attend,
            And then their silver voices blend,
            Each shining thread of sound prolong,
            And weave the magic woof of song.
            Pleas’d Philomela takes her stand
            On high, and leads the fairy band,
            Pours sweet at intervals her strain,
            And guides with beating wing the train.
            Whilst interrupted zephyrs bear
            Hoarse murmurs from the distant wear;
            And at each pause is heard the swell
            Of Echo’s soft symphonius shell.

              Nor the dread night my mind alarms,—
            NIGHT, and her horrors have their charms.
            O’er the wide forest oft I roam,
            What time the trav’ler, far from home,
            Bewilder’d in the pathless brakes,
            There his cold bed despairing makes;
            And hear the fox with savage bark
            Pay distant courtship through the dark;
            The owl with fault’ring voice unfold
            Her tale, like one who shakes with cold:
            And then the alarmed woods resound
            Th’ upbraidings of the well-train’d hound,
            Who with tremendous tongue arraigns
            And haunts the plunderer of his plains.
            So cries from earth the life-blood spilt,
            So waking furies harrass guilt!

              Oft have I through this solemn glade
            Of old dismember’d hollies stray’d,
            Whose bold bare rugged brows are seen
            Thrust through the mantling ever-green;
            Tall clustring columns here ascend,
            And there in gothic arches bend;[10]
            Whilst, as the silver moon-beams rise,
            Imagin’d temples strike my eyes,
            With tottering spire, and mouldering wall,
            And high roof nodding to its fall.—
            His lantern gleaming down the glade,
            One, like a sexton with his spade,[11]
            Comes from their caverns to exclude
            The mid-night prowlers of the wood.—
            Through fields of air while pausing slow,
            Yon death-bell tells the village woe!

              Born on her clouds when Darkness flings
            O’er the still air her raven wings,
            Ere yet the watery freight descends,
            While Heaven it’s purposes suspends,
            NIGHT, let me stand in silent trance,
            And watch the lightning’s kindling glance:
            While, stiff’ning at the imagin’d stroke,
            Appears behind a brighten’d oak,
            From justice fled to this wild place,
            A conscious robber’s gastly face!—
            Or fancy views with fear-fix’d eye
            A mangled spectre gliding by,
            Quick with the flash who seems to wave
            His pale hand, beck’ning to a grave!—
            And, as the fleeting vision dies,
            Loud thunders shake the closing skies.

              NIGHT, when rude blasts thy scenes deform,
            O place me in the perilous storm!
            While the moon labouring thro’ the clouds
            By turns her light reveals and shrouds;
            Torn from it’s trunk, when whirlwinds bear
            The twisted ash aloft in air:
            And some vast elm’s uprooted spoil
            Ploughs in its headlong fall the soil.
            While, as he stalks thro’ groaning oaks,
            At intervals the old deer croaks:
            And the lean sow with paps drawn dry
            O’er rustling leaves trots whining by.—

              Then posts across the blasted plain,
            Born on the wild storm, Witchcraft’s train,
            Aghast with guilt, and shrunk with age,
            And yelling with demoniack rage!—
            With eyes turn’d back malign and wide
            See blood-stain’d Murder silent stride,
            A moon-beam’s sudden light expands,
            He starts, and hides his crimson hands!—
            And now the cauldron gleams afar,
            Fir’d by a baneful meteor’s glare,
            Around they dance, they pause, and pour
            The mischiefs of the midnight hour;
            While trembling fiends with wonder gaze,
            Stretch their black wings, and fan the blaze!


                               PART, III.

           Ere Night withdraws her starry train,
           I print long traces o’er the plain,
           And bend my eyes to yon bright east
           To meet the Morning’s radiant guest,
           As o’er the hill his golden rays
           Burst thro’ the thicket in a blaze.
           Now from my foot the startled fawn
           Bounds to its parent on the lawn;
           And the wak’d lark exulting springs,
           Hangs high in air on quivering wings,
           Chaunts his loud transports o’er the heath,
           And eyes his list’ning loves beneath.

             Oft shall my TALBOT hither stray,
           And friendship give new joys to day;
           On him his blooming bride attend,
           Hither her graceful footsteps bend,
           Fresh life her brighter beauties fling
           O’er the young dawn, and blossom’d spring.

             They come! their eddying wheels resound,
           The harness’d coursers proudly bound,
           The light-hung chariot floats in air,
           And laughing Hymen wreaths the pair!
           As o’er the daisy’d lawns they move
           By glittering rill or dusky grove,
           Old NEEDWOOD calls his softest gale,
           Bids all his fragrant buds exhale:
           His gazing herds around them throng,
           His plighted birds suspend their song,
           Each on her urn his Naiads lean,
           And Wood-nymphs peep from allies green.

             Where this gay mount o’er-looks the wood,[12]
           Charm’d with the scene a monarch stood,
           Call’d these fair plains the richest gem,
           That deck’d his triple diadem,
           Awhile the cares of state forgot,
           And with it’s name adorn’d the spot.

             Down yon meridian fields afar
           When Mercia led her chiefs to war,
           Fell in one hour three monarchs brave,
           And LICHFIELD’S bower protects their grave.[13]
           Her stately spires amidst the skies
           Ting’d by the orient sun arise,
           With golden vanes invite the gale.—
           Triumphant ladies of the vale!

             Down yon mid-vale the british Nile,[14]
           Fair DOVE, comes winding many a mile;
           And from his copious urn distils
           The fatness of a thousand hills.
           Swell, generous river, leave thy banks,
           The thirsty soil shall give thee thanks!—
           The generous river swells, and leads
           His waters o’er impoverish’d meads,
           And lays his ample treasure down,
           Rich emblem of thy bounty, BROWN![15]

             Pleas’d on yon high abode I gaze,
           Whence C’ANDISH foaming Dove surveys:[16]
           And where those humbler vales extend
           Of thine, FITZHERBERT, chearful friend.[17]
           Or mark upon yon round ascent
           The social flag and open tent,[18]
           Where life’s smooth paths with sweets are strown,
           And mirth makes every hour it’s own.

             Where spreads this grove it’s umbrage wide
           Late the bold Outlaw fought and died.[19]
           Oft in it’s dark recess the oak
           Had fall’n beneath his secret stroke,
           Full many a deer the night’s dim ray
           Beheld his silent arrow slay,
           Deep furze conceal’d the fawns in vain,
           And lust of lucre thinn’d the plain.
           Here, by no power before controll’d,
           He met a forester as bold;
           O’er the fierce conflict frown’d the wood,
           And drank with thirsty roots his blood.

             Yon bank demands a pitying look,
           Where life a gentler breast forsook;[20]
           Sole comfort of an aged pair!
           The true-love of a damsel fair!—
           At prime of dawn he stepp’d away;
           Long was the journey, short the day;
           The wint’ry blast blew loud and chill;
           Night caught him on the unshelter’d hill;
           Fatigu’d he fell; no help came nigh;
           His faithful dog alone was by;
           Who, as he fondly lick’d his cheek,
           Heard his expiring master speak.
           “Heap not for me thy cottage-fire;
           “Cold grows my heart, unhappy sire!
           “But turn to my unfinish’d loom,
           “And weave the web, and bear it home!
           “Prepare not, dame, my evening meal;
           “But bid them ring my passing peal!
           “Deck not thyself, dear maid, to meet
           “Thy love; but bring his winding sheet!
           “I come not to your festive cheer;
           “Ye comrades, place me on my bier!—”
           —The morrow found him stiff and pale:
           Mournful the Muse recounts his tale.

             Her stately tower there HANBURY rears,
           Which proudly looks o’er distant shires;
           Down the chill slope and darken’d glade
           Projects afar it’s length of shade;
           Assails the skies with giant force,
           And checks the whirlwind in it’s course;
           Or, when black clouds involve the pole,
           Disarms the thunders, as they roll!—
           Beneath how Nature throws around
           Grand inequalities of ground,
           While down the dells and o’er the steeps
           The wavy line of Paphos creeps!—

             With awful sorrow I behold
           Yon cliff, that frowns with ruins old;[21]
           Stout FERRERS there kept faithless ward,[22]
           And GAUNT perform’d his Castle-guard.[23]
           There captive MARY look’d in vain[24]
           For NORFOLK, and her nuptial train;
           Enrich’d with royal tears the Dove,
           But sigh’d for freedom, not from love.
           ’Twas once the seat of festive state,
           Where high born dames and nobles sat;
           While minstrels, each in order heard,[25]
           Their venerable songs preferr’d.
           False memory of it’s state remains
           In the rude sport of brutal swains.[26]
           Now serpents hiss, and foxes dwell
           Amidst the mould’ring citadel;
           And time but spares those broken towers
           In mockery of human powers.

             Yon hill, that glows with southern rays,[27]
           All-conscious of superior praise,
           Swells her smooth top and pastures green,
           And of her sisters seems the queen;
           Proud from her ancient seats to trace
           The lineage of a generous race.
           “That generous race,” fair SUDBURY cries,
           “Is mine,” and bids her turrets rise,
           Lifts from the lap of peace her dome,
           Where finds Munificence a home;
           Then wide her shining lake she leads
           Through blossom’d groves and emerald meads,
           Cloaths with dark woods the distant scene,
           And pours her dappled herds between.
           —Ah me! what sudden sadness lowers
           O’er her fair front and vernal bowers!
           There sinks to her untimely tomb
           A virgin flower in beauty’s bloom!
           O thou wast all that youth admires,
           A parent loves, or friend desires!
           I knew thee well! my sorrowing heart
           Bears in thy loss a bitter part!—
           Whilst the sad Muse in plaintive verse
           Strews all her flowers around thy hearse,
           Let Pity quit thy grave, and go
           A mourner to yon house of woe.
           There from thy father’s bosom break
           Sighs, which too eloquently speak:
           Thy mother weeps, but weeps resign’d,
           In all things noble, most in mind:
           Pale griefs thy sisters’ cheeks invade;
           And one, alas, too tender maid!
           Holds a long melancholy strife
           Betwixt her sorrows and her life:
           Thy manly brothers strive to cure
           In vain, the pangs themselves endure.
           Fair Saint! a happier lot is thine
           Repos’d beneath the silent shrine!

             Now let me seek in pensive mood
           The rude recesses of the wood;
           And, where congenial gloom extends,
           Think of lost hopes and distant friends;
           Of scenes, whose pleasures fled too fast,
           And hours most valued now they’re past!

             Beside me lies a dingle deep,[28]
           With shaggy banks abrupt and steep;
           Through vistas wild my course I bend,
           Till day-light opens at the end:
           Where from intoxicating height
           Bursts the wide prospect on my sight.
           The terrace bold, on which I stand,
           Steps broad and forward on the land;
           Rude hills compose the side-long scene,
           With crofts and cottages between:
           The various landscape onward spreads
           O’er cultur’d plains and verdant meads;
           And seats, and towns, and hamlets rise,
           Where yon smoke curls into the skies,
           And spires, that pierce thro’ tufted trees;
           Till, faintly fading by degrees,
           Beyond, in wild confusion tost,
           The hills blue tops in clouds are lost.

             Yes, EATON-BANKS, in vain I strive[29]
           To hide the grief your oaks revive.—
           Bow thy tall branches, grateful wood!
           Afford me blossom, leaf, and bud!
           He, for whose memory these I blend,
           Thy late-lost master, was my friend!—
           Fall, gentle dews! fresh zephyrs, breathe!
           Spread, cooling shades! preserve my wreath!—
           Alas, it withers ere its time!—
           So faded he in manly prime!—
           But Virtue, scorning friendship’s aid,
           Rears her own palms, which never fade!
           _Needwood!_ if e’er my early voice
           Hath taught thy echoes to rejoice;
           If e’er my hounds in opening cry
           Have fill’d thy banks with ecstacy;
           If e’er array’d in cheerful green
           Our train hath deck’d thy wintry scene;
           Ere yet thy wood-wild walks I leave,
           My tributary verse receive:
           With thy own wreath my brows adorn,
           And to thy praises tune my horn!

             What green-rob’d Nymph, all loose her hair,
           With buskin’d leg, and bosom bare,
           Steps lightly down the turfy glades,
           And beckons tow’rd yon opening shades?—
           No harlot-form, dissembling guile
           With wanton air and painted smile,
           Lures to enchanted halls or bowers,
           Where festive Vice consumes his hours.
           Her mild and modest looks dispense
           The simple charm of innocence:
           And a sweet wildness in her eye
           Sparkles with young sincerity.—
           Lead on, fair guide, ere wakes the dawn,
           With thee I’ll climb the steepy lawn,
           With thee the leafy labyrinths trace,
           Where dwells the Genius of the place.—
           His large limbs press a prim-rose bed,
           A moss-grown root sustains his head,
           And, list’ning to a Druid’s rhimes,
           He bends his eye on distant times:
           While troops of sylvan Vassals meet
           To cast their garlands at his feet,
           And pipe and frisk in rings about,
           Or parly with the Hunter’s shout.
           And now a fragrant show’r he throws
           Of blossoms from his curled brows,
           And rising waves his oaken wand,
           And bids yon magic scenes expand!—

             First blush the hills with orient light,
           And pierce the sable veil of night,
           Green bends the waving shade above,
           And glist’ring dew-drops gem the grove:
           Next shine the shelving lawns around,
           Bright threads of silver net the ground;
           And down, the entangled brakes among,
           The white rill sparkling winds along:
           Then, as the pausing zephyrs breathe,
           The billowy mist recedes beneath;
           Slow, as it rolls away, unfold
           The vale’s fresh glories green and gold;
           DOVE[1] laughs, and shakes his tresses bright,
           And trails afar a line of light.

             Now glows the illumin’d landscape round!
           Ye Vulgar hence!—’tis sacred ground!
           Hence to the flimsy walks of art,
           That lull, but not transport the heart.
           Nature, O Muse, here sits alone,
           And marks these regions for thy own;
           Here her variety of joys
           Nor season bounds, nor change destroys:
           Be mine the pride, tho’ weak my strains,
           That first I woo’d thee to these plains;
           Where Spring, in all her beauty drest,
           But promises a brighter guest:
           Where Summer yields her greens and flowers
           To Autumn’s variegated bowers:
           Smiles Winter, as their honours fall,
           And bids his hollies shame them all.[2]

             Ye sage Professors of design,
           Whom system’s stubborn rules confine,
           Can science here one blemish show?
           Or one deficient grace bestow?
           EMES,[3] who yon desart wild explor’d,
           And to it’s name the scene restor’d;
           Whose art is nature’s law maintain’d,
           Whose order negligence restrain’d,
           Here, fir’d by native beauty, trac’d
           The foot-steps of the Goddess, Taste:
           Won from her coy retreats she came,
           And led him up these paths to fame.

             Here ev’ry flower improves the gale
           From the meek violet of the vale
           To her, who flaunts in air sublime,
           The woodbine, queen of summer’s prime:
           While each delicious shade may vie
           With those of boasted Arcady.
           There sweet varieties appear
           Of thickets, shap’d by nibbling Deer,
           Of hills, that swell with gradual ease,
           Wood-skirted lawns, and scatter’d trees;
           Of vallies seen down distant glades,
           That break the mass of mingling shades;
           While nature’s attribute, extent,
           Crowns each inferior ornament!—

             On this green unambitious brow,
           Fair Mistress of the vale below,
           With sloping hills enclos’d around,
           Their heads with oaks and hollies crown’d,
           With lucky choice, by happy hands,
           Plac’d in good hour, my dwelling stands;
           And draws the distant trav’ler’s eye,
           Enamour’d of it’s scenery;
           Where all things give, what all express,
           Content and rural happiness.
           Where far retir’d from life’s dull form
           Comes no intruder but the storm;
           The storm, that with contrasted low’r
           Endears the fair the silent hour.

             Thus their wise days our fathers led,
           Fleet ran their hounds, their arrows sped,
           And jocund Health with rosy smile
           Look’d on, companion of their toil:
           Till tyrant Law usurp’d the land,
           Stretch’d o’er the woods his iron hand,
           Forbad the echoing horn to blow,
           Maim’d the staunch hound, and snapp’d the bow.[4]

             Here with fair peace and modest fame[5]
           They dwelt, who boasted Bagot’s name,—
           Go, BAGOT, plead your country’s cause,
           While senates listen with applause,
           With fearless truth and manly sense
           Detecting specious eloquence:
           Great talents to the world are due,
           Retirement were a crime in you.
           Go, and receive your oaken crown!
           Here, with no title to renown,
           Leave me to loiter at my door
           Beneath the spreading sycamore,
           That canopies the sloping lawn;
           And view the deer at early dawn
           In troops come winding down the hill
           To taste fresh herbage near the rill;
           Or count at noon their slumb’ring heaps;
           At evening watch their playful leaps;
           Or hear the quiring of the grove
           Give breath to harmony and love;
           Or listen to the hum profound,
           In the still air that floats around;
           Or mark yon hills extended side,
           Where turf and shade the space divide;—
           Here the wood straggles tow’rd the plain,
           The pasture there prevails again;
           The heifer grazes on it’s brow,
           Clamours the rook on trees below;
           Gay golden furze and purple ling
           Around their mixt embroidery fling,
           O’er all, irregularly join’d,
           Th’ according outline waves behind.

             No dusky Cares o’er-hang the bower,
           No Passions wreck the halcyon hour;
           Nurs’d in the shade Reflection springs,
           Smooths her white plumes, and tries her wings.
           No leaf of autumn falls in vain;
           No flower-bell droops beneath the rain,
           No bubble down the current flows,
           But life’s uncertain tenure shows.
           Those thorns protect the forest’s hopes;
           That tree the slender ivy props:
           Thus rise the mighty on the mean!
           Thus on the strong the feeble lean!
           In yonder holly—blush mankind!—
           A rare fidelity I find;
           Like yours tho’ summer’s flatteries end,
           My winter here hath found a friend.—
           Hail faithful fav’rite tree! to you
           The Muse shall pay observance due:
           Whether in horrent files you stand
           Round sapling oaks a guardian band;
           Or form aloft a shelt’ring bower
           Impervious to the sun or shower;
           Whether to yon hill-side you throng
           Ranging in various groups along;
           Or on the plain, maturely grown,
           You boldly brave the storm alone,
           Or tapering high, with woodbines hid,
           Rise in a fragrant pyramid;
           Your vigorous youth with upright shoots,
           Your verdant age, your glowing fruits,
           Your glossy leaves, and columns gray
           Shall live the favorites of my lay!

             Alas! in vain with warmth and food
           You cheer the songsters of the wood,
           The barbarous boy from you prepares
           On treacherous twigs his viscous snares.
           Yes, the poor bird, you nurs’d, shall find
           Destruction in your rifled rind.
           Thus good and ill too often meet,
           And bitter mingles with the sweet!
           —Ye pedagogues! let truant youth
           Imbibe from you this gen’rous truth;
           That one humane, one tender thought
           Is worth the whole, that schools have taught.


                               PART, II.

            With what fond gaze my eye pursues,
            _NEEDWOOD_, thy sweetly-varying views!
            Satyr, or Nymph, or sylvan God
            A fairer circuit never trod!
            Charm’d, as I turn, thy pictures seem
            The golden fabricks of a dream.
            Where Fiction stands with prism bright,
            Rays forth her many-colour’d light,
            Dyes the green herb, and purple flower,
            Gives glittering lustres to the shower;
            Then gilds with livelier tints the sky,
            Or bends her radiant bow on high.

              To scenes so elegantly wild
            Fancy, of old, her darling child
            From AVON’S flowery margin brought,
            And ARDEN boasts what NEEDWOOD taught.[6]

              Such shades by mazy paths perplex’d,
            Where strays the traveller inly vex’d,
            Inspir’d the Muse of SPENCER’S pen;
            The _wandering wood_, and _Errors den_,[7]
            Dwarfs, Palfreys, Dames, and Giants rise
            Full on Imaginations eyes!
            See, See the Sarazin advance!
            The red-cross Knight hath couch’d his lance!
            They meet, the Christian wins the field,
            And bears away the _faithless_ shield![8]

              With such companions fond to rove,
            I venerate each hill and grove,
            To Phœbus as to Dian dear,
            And find a new Parnassus here.
            Here might the sacred sisters dwell
            By pebbly brook, or gushing well:
            O let me listen, as they sing,
            In some close vale beside a spring,
            Whose stream the intruding alder chides,
            Where the wild-bee her treasure hides!—
            Or sit in high imbowering shade
            With Contemplation, heav’n-ey’d maid,
            Where the scant sun through branches thin
            Chequers the dark green floor within;
            Where ev’ry leaf is wisdom’s page,
            And each gray trunk a hoary sage.
            Nor motion, human form, or noise
            This solemn pause of life destroys;
            Save where the playful squirrel bounds,
            Or ring-dove pours her plaintive sounds,
            Or lurking peasant lops an oak
            Restraining half his pilfering stroke,
            Or with his faggot stoops to rest
            Both by his years and burthen prest.

              Here, seen of old, the elfin race
            With sprightly vigils mark’d the place;
            Their gay processions charm’d the sight,
            Gilding the lucid noon of night;
            Or, when obscure the midnight hour,
            With glow-worm lantherns hung the bower.
            —Hark!—the soft lute! along the green
            Moves with majestic step the queen!
            Attendant Fays around her throng,
            And trace the dance or raise the song;
            Or touch the shrill reed, as they trip,
            With finger light and ruby lip.

              High, on her brow sublime, is born
            One scarlet wood-bine’s tremulous horn;
            A gaudy bee-bird’s triple plume[9]
            Sheds on her neck its waving gloom;
            With silvery gossamer entwin’d
            Stream the luxuriant locks behind.
            Thin folds of tangled network break
            In airy waves adown her neck:
            Warp’d in his loom, the spider spread
            The far-diverging rays of thread,
            Then round and round with shuttle fine
            Inwrought the undulating line.
            One rose-leaf forms her crimson vest,
            The loose edge crosses o’er her breast.
            And one translucent fold, which fell
            From the tall lily’s ample bell,
            Forms with sweet grace her snowy train,
            Flows, as she steps, and sweeps the plain.
            Silence and Night inchanted gaze,
            And Hesper hides his vanquish’d rays!—

              Now the wak’d reed-birds swell their throats,
            And night-larks trill their mingled notes:
            Yet hush’d in moss with writhed neck
            The black-bird hides his golden beak;
            Charm’d from his dream of love, he wakes,
            Opes his gay eye, his plumage shakes,
            And stretching wide each ebon wing,
            First in low whispers tries to sing;
            Then sounds his clarion loud, and thrills
            The moon-bright lawns, and shadowy hills.
            Silent the choral Fays attend,
            And then their silver voices blend,
            Each shining thread of sound prolong,
            And weave the magic woof of song.
            Pleas’d Philomela takes her stand
            On high, and leads the fairy band,
            Pours sweet at intervals her strain,
            And guides with beating wing the train.
            Whilst interrupted zephyrs bear
            Hoarse murmurs from the distant wear;
            And at each pause is heard the swell
            Of Echo’s soft symphonius shell.

              Nor the dread night my mind alarms,—
            NIGHT, and her horrors have their charms.
            O’er the wide forest oft I roam,
            What time the trav’ler, far from home,
            Bewilder’d in the pathless brakes,
            There his cold bed despairing makes;
            And hear the fox with savage bark
            Pay distant courtship through the dark;
            The owl with fault’ring voice unfold
            Her tale, like one who shakes with cold:
            And then the alarmed woods resound
            Th’ upbraidings of the well-train’d hound,
            Who with tremendous tongue arraigns
            And haunts the plunderer of his plains.
            So cries from earth the life-blood spilt,
            So waking furies harrass guilt!

              Oft have I through this solemn glade
            Of old dismember’d hollies stray’d,
            Whose bold bare rugged brows are seen
            Thrust through the mantling ever-green;
            Tall clustring columns here ascend,
            And there in gothic arches bend;[10]
            Whilst, as the silver moon-beams rise,
            Imagin’d temples strike my eyes,
            With tottering spire, and mouldering wall,
            And high roof nodding to its fall.—
            His lantern gleaming down the glade,
            One, like a sexton with his spade,[11]
            Comes from their caverns to exclude
            The mid-night prowlers of the wood.—
            Through fields of air while pausing slow,
            Yon death-bell tells the village woe!

              Born on her clouds when Darkness flings
            O’er the still air her raven wings,
            Ere yet the watery freight descends,
            While Heaven it’s purposes suspends,
            NIGHT, let me stand in silent trance,
            And watch the lightning’s kindling glance:
            While, stiff’ning at the imagin’d stroke,
            Appears behind a brighten’d oak,
            From justice fled to this wild place,
            A conscious robber’s gastly face!—
            Or fancy views with fear-fix’d eye
            A mangled spectre gliding by,
            Quick with the flash who seems to wave
            His pale hand, beck’ning to a grave!—
            And, as the fleeting vision dies,
            Loud thunders shake the closing skies.

              NIGHT, when rude blasts thy scenes deform,
            O place me in the perilous storm!
            While the moon labouring thro’ the clouds
            By turns her light reveals and shrouds;
            Torn from it’s trunk, when whirlwinds bear
            The twisted ash aloft in air:
            And some vast elm’s uprooted spoil
            Ploughs in its headlong fall the soil.
            While, as he stalks thro’ groaning oaks,
            At intervals the old deer croaks:
            And the lean sow with paps drawn dry
            O’er rustling leaves trots whining by.—

              Then posts across the blasted plain,
            Born on the wild storm, Witchcraft’s train,
            Aghast with guilt, and shrunk with age,
            And yelling with demoniack rage!—
            With eyes turn’d back malign and wide
            See blood-stain’d Murder silent stride,
            A moon-beam’s sudden light expands,
            He starts, and hides his crimson hands!—
            And now the cauldron gleams afar,
            Fir’d by a baneful meteor’s glare,
            Around they dance, they pause, and pour
            The mischiefs of the midnight hour;
            While trembling fiends with wonder gaze,
            Stretch their black wings, and fan the blaze!


                               PART, III.

           Ere Night withdraws her starry train,
           I print long traces o’er the plain,
           And bend my eyes to yon bright east
           To meet the Morning’s radiant guest,
           As o’er the hill his golden rays
           Burst thro’ the thicket in a blaze.
           Now from my foot the startled fawn
           Bounds to its parent on the lawn;
           And the wak’d lark exulting springs,
           Hangs high in air on quivering wings,
           Chaunts his loud transports o’er the heath,
           And eyes his list’ning loves beneath.

             Oft shall my TALBOT hither stray,
           And friendship give new joys to day;
           On him his blooming bride attend,
           Hither her graceful footsteps bend,
           Fresh life her brighter beauties fling
           O’er the young dawn, and blossom’d spring.

             They come! their eddying wheels resound,
           The harness’d coursers proudly bound,
           The light-hung chariot floats in air,
           And laughing Hymen wreaths the pair!
           As o’er the daisy’d lawns they move
           By glittering rill or dusky grove,
           Old NEEDWOOD calls his softest gale,
           Bids all his fragrant buds exhale:
           His gazing herds around them throng,
           His plighted birds suspend their song,
           Each on her urn his Naiads lean,
           And Wood-nymphs peep from allies green.

             Where this gay mount o’er-looks the wood,[12]
           Charm’d with the scene a monarch stood,
           Call’d these fair plains the richest gem,
           That deck’d his triple diadem,
           Awhile the cares of state forgot,
           And with it’s name adorn’d the spot.

             Down yon meridian fields afar
           When Mercia led her chiefs to war,
           Fell in one hour three monarchs brave,
           And LICHFIELD’S bower protects their grave.[13]
           Her stately spires amidst the skies
           Ting’d by the orient sun arise,
           With golden vanes invite the gale.—
           Triumphant ladies of the vale!

             Down yon mid-vale the british Nile,[14]
           Fair DOVE, comes winding many a mile;
           And from his copious urn distils
           The fatness of a thousand hills.
           Swell, generous river, leave thy banks,
           The thirsty soil shall give thee thanks!—
           The generous river swells, and leads
           His waters o’er impoverish’d meads,
           And lays his ample treasure down,
           Rich emblem of thy bounty, BROWN![15]

             Pleas’d on yon high abode I gaze,
           Whence C’ANDISH foaming Dove surveys:[16]
           And where those humbler vales extend
           Of thine, FITZHERBERT, chearful friend.[17]
           Or mark upon yon round ascent
           The social flag and open tent,[18]
           Where life’s smooth paths with sweets are strown,
           And mirth makes every hour it’s own.

             Where spreads this grove it’s umbrage wide
           Late the bold Outlaw fought and died.[19]
           Oft in it’s dark recess the oak
           Had fall’n beneath his secret stroke,
           Full many a deer the night’s dim ray
           Beheld his silent arrow slay,
           Deep furze conceal’d the fawns in vain,
           And lust of lucre thinn’d the plain.
           Here, by no power before controll’d,
           He met a forester as bold;
           O’er the fierce conflict frown’d the wood,
           And drank with thirsty roots his blood.

             Yon bank demands a pitying look,
           Where life a gentler breast forsook;[20]
           Sole comfort of an aged pair!
           The true-love of a damsel fair!—
           At prime of dawn he stepp’d away;
           Long was the journey, short the day;
           The wint’ry blast blew loud and chill;
           Night caught him on the unshelter’d hill;
           Fatigu’d he fell; no help came nigh;
           His faithful dog alone was by;
           Who, as he fondly lick’d his cheek,
           Heard his expiring master speak.
           “Heap not for me thy cottage-fire;
           “Cold grows my heart, unhappy sire!
           “But turn to my unfinish’d loom,
           “And weave the web, and bear it home!
           “Prepare not, dame, my evening meal;
           “But bid them ring my passing peal!
           “Deck not thyself, dear maid, to meet
           “Thy love; but bring his winding sheet!
           “I come not to your festive cheer;
           “Ye comrades, place me on my bier!—”
           —The morrow found him stiff and pale:
           Mournful the Muse recounts his tale.

             Her stately tower there HANBURY rears,
           Which proudly looks o’er distant shires;
           Down the chill slope and darken’d glade
           Projects afar it’s length of shade;
           Assails the skies with giant force,
           And checks the whirlwind in it’s course;
           Or, when black clouds involve the pole,
           Disarms the thunders, as they roll!—
           Beneath how Nature throws around
           Grand inequalities of ground,
           While down the dells and o’er the steeps
           The wavy line of Paphos creeps!—

             With awful sorrow I behold
           Yon cliff, that frowns with ruins old;[21]
           Stout FERRERS there kept faithless ward,[22]
           And GAUNT perform’d his Castle-guard.[23]
           There captive MARY look’d in vain[24]
           For NORFOLK, and her nuptial train;
           Enrich’d with royal tears the Dove,
           But sigh’d for freedom, not from love.
           ’Twas once the seat of festive state,
           Where high born dames and nobles sat;
           While minstrels, each in order heard,[25]
           Their venerable songs preferr’d.
           False memory of it’s state remains
           In the rude sport of brutal swains.[26]
           Now serpents hiss, and foxes dwell
           Amidst the mould’ring citadel;
           And time but spares those broken towers
           In mockery of human powers.

             Yon hill, that glows with southern rays,[27]
           All-conscious of superior praise,
           Swells her smooth top and pastures green,
           And of her sisters seems the queen;
           Proud from her ancient seats to trace
           The lineage of a generous race.
           “That generous race,” fair SUDBURY cries,
           “Is mine,” and bids her turrets rise,
           Lifts from the lap of peace her dome,
           Where finds Munificence a home;
           Then wide her shining lake she leads
           Through blossom’d groves and emerald meads,
           Cloaths with dark woods the distant scene,
           And pours her dappled herds between.
           —Ah me! what sudden sadness lowers
           O’er her fair front and vernal bowers!
           There sinks to her untimely tomb
           A virgin flower in beauty’s bloom!
           O thou wast all that youth admires,
           A parent loves, or friend desires!
           I knew thee well! my sorrowing heart
           Bears in thy loss a bitter part!—
           Whilst the sad Muse in plaintive verse
           Strews all her flowers around thy hearse,
           Let Pity quit thy grave, and go
           A mourner to yon house of woe.
           There from thy father’s bosom break
           Sighs, which too eloquently speak:
           Thy mother weeps, but weeps resign’d,
           In all things noble, most in mind:
           Pale griefs thy sisters’ cheeks invade;
           And one, alas, too tender maid!
           Holds a long melancholy strife
           Betwixt her sorrows and her life:
           Thy manly brothers strive to cure
           In vain, the pangs themselves endure.
           Fair Saint! a happier lot is thine
           Repos’d beneath the silent shrine!

             Now let me seek in pensive mood
           The rude recesses of the wood;
           And, where congenial gloom extends,
           Think of lost hopes and distant friends;
           Of scenes, whose pleasures fled too fast,
           And hours most valued now they’re past!

             Beside me lies a dingle deep,[28]
           With shaggy banks abrupt and steep;
           Through vistas wild my course I bend,
           Till day-light opens at the end:
           Where from intoxicating height
           Bursts the wide prospect on my sight.
           The terrace bold, on which I stand,
           Steps broad and forward on the land;
           Rude hills compose the side-long scene,
           With crofts and cottages between:
           The various landscape onward spreads
           O’er cultur’d plains and verdant meads;
           And seats, and towns, and hamlets rise,
           Where yon smoke curls into the skies,
           And spires, that pierce thro’ tufted trees;
           Till, faintly fading by degrees,
           Beyond, in wild confusion tost,
           The hills blue tops in clouds are lost.

             Yes, EATON-BANKS, in vain I strive[29]
           To hide the grief your oaks revive.—
           Bow thy tall branches, grateful wood!
           Afford me blossom, leaf, and bud!
           He, for whose memory these I blend,
           Thy late-lost master, was my friend!—
           Fall, gentle dews! fresh zephyrs, breathe!
           Spread, cooling shades! preserve my wreath!—
           Alas, it withers ere its time!—
           So faded he in manly prime!—
           But Virtue, scorning friendship’s aid,
           Rears her own palms, which never fade!
